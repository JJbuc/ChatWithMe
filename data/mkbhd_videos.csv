2025-10-21,What's Going on with Apple Vision Pro?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU9aqBv0YdY,"(intriguing music) - This is the Apple Vision Pro, and this is the brand
new second-generation Apple Vision Pro nearly two years later. (tense music) Yeah... (impactful music) So you might have heard that Apple dropped the latest
version of their silicon, the base M5 chip this past week, and they chose to put it in three devices: the iPad Pro, the 14-inch MacBook Pro, and the Vision Pro. (playful music) Okay, so this is actually
a partial upgrade of Apple Silicon. We just got (playful music continues) (box squeaking)
a new M5 chip, right? So anything that has a base chip-- this is the direction of time, and this is the direction of how powerful the chips are-- anything that has a
base chip is a candidate for getting the M5 upgrade, which is why we see this
in things like Vision Pro, which went from M2 to M5. We also see it in the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro, which
go from M4 and M3 to M5. Notably, there is no Pro or Max M5. So things like the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which uses those chips,
doesn't get upgraded yet, stays on M4. We'll probably see that eventually, kind of like we'll probably
also eventually see an M4 Ultra, which we don't have yet, which is why the Mac Pro and Mac Studio are on M3 Ultra and M2 Ultra. I got those backwards. So not respectively. Either way, Mac Mini, iMac, other things that have the base M chip will probably all eventually get M5. And that's about it, I think. Yeah, new chip. (pole clanking) Okay, anyway, aside from that new chip, the new 2025 Vision Pro
is more or less the same as the original from two years ago. Same dimensions, same aluminum frame and glass on the outside, same buttons and Digital
Crown, same speakers, same exact high-resolution
micro-OLED displays on the inside with the same field of view, same exact battery with
the same tethered cable that you put in your pocket while you're wearing the headset. And it has the exact same 12 cameras and sensors and LIDAR scanner all around the outside. And the same R1 chip inside to combine and process all the data from all those sensors, same thermal systems,
same fans, same vents, same outside screen to
see your Persona's eyes. So yeah, much of this is unchanged. Not that you need change
for change's sake, but when the Vision Pro first came out, there were immediately tons of complaints about how heavy it was and how uncomfortable this thing was to wear for long periods of time. And so I would think that maybe there's some work
happening on the internals, maybe thinning out a bit
of that aluminum frame, just saving a few millimeters and a few grams here and there. But no, none of that has
made it to the new one. Matter of fact, the weight of the new one is listed as higher than the original because it comes by default with this new Dual Knit Band, which is where it seems
like 100% of their effort went into making the Vision
Pro more comfortable. And so to their credit, it is actually a really nice and cleverly engineered band. So you probably remember
the first-gen band, this Solo Knit Band, which was in all the commercials and looks really pretty, but the problem is it's pulling up against the back of your head, and it's trying to hold all of the weight from the Vision Pro, and it's not great at it. Basically it ends up
sagging onto your nose and really being incredibly painful to have on your face for
more than 10 minutes. So there were a bunch of
other dual-strap bands that came out, including Apple's own that did a better job and distributed the weight better, but they were also pretty ugly. Not that it mattered to most people, but it mattered to Apple. So they spent presumably
the last two years developing this band, which distributes the weight much better across the back and top of your head. And then this dial right here, you twist to tighten the back and then pop out and
twist to tighten the top. And it is significantly more comfortable. The back fabric piece is a bit smaller than it was in the Solo Knit Band 'cause it doesn't have to be as big. But it also now has
tungsten--literal metal-- in the back to help counterbalance the weight on your face. And you can feel it. Like, the original band
has all these empty slots. You can feel the metal filling in the fabric ones on the new one, and that's the reason for
the higher weight number. Either way, now it's both
much more comfortable and still good looking. And you can also just buy it for the old Vision Pro for $99. So I've been using this new M5 Vision Pro for the past couple days to see if I can actually
see and feel the difference that this new chip makes because yes, every Vision Pro has all the new software
features of visionOS 26: the new, more realistic Personas, the Pinnable Widgets, being able to turn regular photos into spatial scenes, all this cool stuff. So the M5 chip brings a few other incremental improvements here. Basically, it can load apps faster; it can render more pixels; and it's more efficient, so it has longer battery life. Now, the loading apps
faster, it's nice, you know, especially since you're
stuck in this headset and you can't exactly
like reach for your phone or burn time to check notifications while things are loading. So you kind of just have to sit there and wait for it to load. So it's welcome that
things are loading faster, but it's not exactly a game changer. And then same with things like creating spatial scenes
out of still photos. If that's something you do a lot, it's not instant, but it is much faster on this new one. The 10% more rendered pixels, you really aren't gonna notice that, even if you do back-to-back the M2 and M5 versions, like maybe a handful of people on planet Earth ever will. But yeah, it's, you know, the passthrough cameras
are still the same cameras, so it still looks the same. The displays on the inside are still the same displays, so it still looks the same. The slightly faster max refresh rate of 120 hertz versus 100, it's appreciated. But again, it's not major. It's like these aren't huge changes. These are just a bunch of smaller incremental updates
that over a longer time will start to add up on each other. Same thing with the 20%
longer battery life. So yeah, a new band and a spec bump, otherwise same form
factor, same materials, same cameras, same displays, same heavy weight, and same $3,500 price tag. ""So why is this interesting,"" you might be asking? I'm glad you asked. Two reasons: the competition and the strange lack of competition. See Samsung. Samsung has just come along and finally years later actually dropped their full mixed-reality headset running Android XR. You might remember my preview video of it a couple months ago, showing all this stuff
they're promising it can do with lots of equivalent
features to the Vision Pro. You know, in my video,
it's still a prototype, they're calling it ""Project Moohan,"" but now they're bringing
it out to real people and putting it on sale alongside
the Vision Pro this year. But outside of that, there is a noticeable
lack of other companies trying to make their own Vision Pro and make a super-competitive, super-highly-priced,
premium VR/XR headset. And I think that goes alongside all of this crazy development we've seen in the smart-glasses space. Like just last month, I dropped my video on these. These are the Meta Ray-Ban displays, and they're not the
only ones in the space, but they are one example of how much dramatically faster the progress has been on these than the headsets. Like, this makes it look like the Vision Pro is sitting still. And I think in a lot of ways, these are much more appealing to way more people. Vision Pro is, of course,
a first-gen product, which means that we and Apple didn't really exactly know how people would use this thing. And it comes out, and a lot of people are willing to spend the $3,500 on it. But then two years later, it turns out most of the use of Vision Pro has been watching movies
and gathering dust, which is a shame because it's capable of
so, so, so much more. But it turns out people
like the smart glasses, which only do a subset of
what the headsets can do because they carry a much
lesser social penalty while wearing them in public. And you know, you still
get a first-person camera, you can listen to music, you can ask questions,
get directions, et cetera. And yes, they are still nerdy, but not as nerdy as this. So to answer the question in the title, I think Apple has now, you know, seen all of this and they've gotten the sales numbers and the usage stats and all that. And I think they've
realized that, you know, this isn't gonna be
some gigantic smash hit, and they've kind of trimmed it back and dedicated a little bit less to it, not given up obviously. And there's still plenty
that Apple's doing with, you know, ""Liquid Glass"" and the spatial videos
and stuff like that. But I think they know now, ""Okay, this isn't some huge smash hit, maybe allocate resources
towards some other stuff."" There's even been some other reporting that they've scrapped plans for a future lightweight version of the Vision Pro that was going to come up after this, like the ""Vision Pro Air."" And they're shifting those resources to try to develop smart glasses to jump on that train. And that's actually perfectly in line with this video I made in October 2023 trying to figure out how we get to this mixed-reality dream. So in case you haven't watched that video, spoiler or TL;DR: Tech companies are trying to achieve this awesome face-computer vision of the future for everyday use from two different directions: by building these incredible headsets and then trimming them down or by building these smart glasses and building them up. And it turns out maybe, just maybe, one of those directions
has way more traction now than the other, at least for the everyday computer part. Turns out there's way less people who wanna spend significant time in a face-computer, even if it's really impressive, even if those pixels
with the passthrough mode represent the world around
you while they're on. There's just nothing quite like having actual reality through some glass with some stuff overlaid on top. But again, only time will tell. We'll see. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys the next one. Peace. (upbeat music)

2025-10-14,Xiaomi 17 Pro Max: An iPhone... But Better!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eou_g_cYCew,"- So this is the iPhone 17 Pro Max and this is the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max. And at first glance, it would
be very easy to dismiss this as just another Chinese iPhone clone because it kinda is, and that's kind of how
it first hit my radar. Xiaomi has been making their
flagships very friendly to iPhone users for years now,
and this one's no exception. It's an extremely similar shape. It has the same flat sides, the speakers and the antenna lines, and just the general
aesthetic look familiar. Like this one's camera
plateau is very reminiscent of the new iPhone's, and
it doesn't end there. The software experience
has also, for years, taken some not so subtle cues from iOS, from the quick control pull down to certain stock app aesthetics to even certain widgets and icons. They have their own dynamic
island going on up there and Xiaomi even, yes, changed the name of their whole flagship phone
lineup, skipping a number, to match the iPhone's. So yes, there is a base Xiaomi 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max this year. But as I talked about
in my switching video, link below the like button, that stuff's just to get you in the door. That's just to make you comfortable. But then, once you start looking
into the rest of this phone and actually using it like I have, that's when you're exposed to all the rest of what makes it so good. And this phone is a
spec monster that feels, I guess, specifically
designed to one up the iPhone. It's like an iPhone but better. Like take this display, for example. This is the Pro Max,
so it's the same size, 6.9 inch diagonal, as the iPhone Pro Max. Pretty similar, even
bezels all the way around. Now it's actually slightly
beat on resolution, but you can never tell
that with your eyes. What you can tell is it
does get noticeably brighter and it has a much
smaller cutout at the top because it trades face ID for a super fast ultrasonic
fingerprint reader underneath the display. So you know, like an iPhone, but better. But you know, maybe all that's
not that impressive to you. Like the iPhone's display
isn't that unbeatable. What about the chip? Because the iPhone Pro Max is
the one you get when you want the absolute maximum performance and that A19 Pro chip with the vapor chamber is pretty sick. But the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max is one of the first phones shipping with the new Qualcomm flagship chip, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and turns out it's made some
solid strides in performance over the already impressive
Snapdragon 8 Elite to the point where it's essentially now matching the iPhone's record breaking single core performance bar for bar and it's actually beating
it in multi-core and GPU. So now it has credible claim to just be the world's
fastest mobile chip, period, and it's paired with 16 gigs of RAM and up to a terabyte of
fast UFS 4.1 storage. So yeah, I'd say like
an iPhone, but better. But okay, every flagship
phone is fast these days. That's just bragging rights, you know, a little higher benchmark
scores here or there, whatever. What about battery? That's where the Pro Max is
supposed to excel, right? Yeah. So the smaller Xiaomi 17 Pro
is already super impressive, thanks to this highest
density silicon carbon battery we've ever seen. It is a 6,300 milliamp hour battery. That's already bigger than the S25 Ultra, bigger than the OnePlus 13, bigger than any iPhone
ever made by a mile, and that's without getting
rid of the sim card tray. But then this Pro Max, well this Pro Max has a
7,500 milliamp hour battery. 7,500 milliamp hours and it has 100 watt wired charging with a charger that comes in the box and it has 50 watt wireless charging. This thing is ridiculous. You know, I haven't really
had it long enough to test it, just a few days, and I can't
even really daily this phone, since it's the China only
model, which is a bummer, but I kind of have zero doubts that this is gonna be a
great battery performer. So if that's something
you care about at all, with a Pro Max flagship
phone, it's all here. And the fact that it's silicon carbon means you get all this extra capacity but the phone's not any thicker
or heavier because of it. Matter of fact, this phone is lighter than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. My favorite stat, though,
might be that it has 22 and a half watt
reverse wireless charging. So you can use this
phone as a battery bank to wireless charge all
kinds of other accessories and could charge up an
iPhone from I think dead to 100% if you really wanted to. So yeah, the battery is kind
of nothing like the iPhone, just better. Now if it's cameras that you care about, well naturally the triple
48 megapixel cameras on the iPhone 17 Pros
will appeal a lot to you. I don't think it's a coincidence, though, that this Xiaomi is nicely outfitted also with triple cameras that
are 50 megapixels each for a nice little one up. But it's not the megapixel
count that matters. What matters is all three of these cameras are actually really good. They're super impressive. They each take very detailed, crisp shots with a naturally shallow depth of field, and honestly mostly decent colors with some different tastes. You know, they tend to overexpose
my skin tone on my face, like a lot of other phones
from this region do. But my own skin tone with no faces detected
is way more accurate. The telephoto has also
been really impressing me. It's a 5x optical zoom and it
has even more natural bokeh and naturally a really nice portrait look. And these are all just
the 12 megapixel stills, not even full 50 megapixel shots. And then there's a bunch of
other really nice customizations in the camera app UI,
things like 8K video, which you're watching right now. Also the little exposure
slider in auto mode, which is always there, I actually use that a lot and it's sweet. Also teleprompter mode, which lets you read text while
you are talking to the camera and no one would ever know, mostly. But there's one more important thing, one more very important thing that I've somehow gotten
this far into the video without mentioning it, which is that if you hit this
little button all the way up in the corner, that turns on the preview on the rear display, the back display. Because yes, that entire
back camera plateau I mentioned earlier is actually
a full, corner to corner, 3,000 nit 120 hertz OLED display. And it's kind of a lot
of screen, actually. On the 17 Pro, it's 2.7 inches diagonally. Here on the Pro Max, it's 2.9 inches, and it's only really interrupted
by the camera cutouts. So turning into a viewfinder for those primary cameras
makes a lot of sense to take just the highest quality selfies mankind has ever seen. Kind of a no-brainer. And then you get all of the
normal photo controls too. You can do zoom, you can
control aspect ratio, and video modes and stuff like that. So that is the number one
use of this back display. But now that it's so much bigger, there's also way more
that you can do with it. You might remember a couple years ago, this is not the first time
Xiaomi's done a screen on the back camera bump
of one of their flagships. The Xiaomi 11 Ultra wasn't that long ago and it had the same thing, an absolutely gigantic camera bump and a little screen on the back. But the thing is, this concept
is kind of evolving now, just like the outside
screen on flipping phones. Like when they were small, you could kind of only
really use it as a clock or maybe a notification alert
banner and that's about it. But then it got a bit bigger and it was enough to see yourself
in the camera view finder. So that was nice. And now the year is 2025 and it's a full screen edge to
edge with just camera cutouts and there's way more you can do with it. So on this phone, you can
double tap to wake it up, where it's showing clock
in whatever style you want. Could be an analog style,
could be a cartoon style, could be an Apple Watch ripoff
style, whatever you want. But once it's awake,
then you can swipe down to check your notifications
and manage them there. You can also swipe over from
the cameras to open straight to the camera app and you can
swipe over from the right edge to close whatever's open. And then a lot of the
customization on the back here is frankly just like an Apple Watch. And that's probably exactly
how Apple would do it if they suddenly had a screen
on the back of the iPhone. So you can hold down and
then swipe to go back and forth between your
watch faces or clock faces. And then if you want to add more options, the settings app has a
whole section dedicated to personalization, changing colors and dialing in all sorts
of looks and themes. Everything from complicated
watch complications to fitness themed widgets
to anime characters. It's everything. And there's a whole marketplace of all sorts of other options. So there's something for everyone. And then just beyond even the
always on clock on the back of the phone that you can always see and see your notifications and the camera view finder, there's all sorts of other
little extra stuff too. Like this feels very well considered. It's like a real, genuine feature, a reason to buy the phone. I feel like they've pushed
it over beyond gimmick into actual useful thing. Like this can also show
ongoing notifications. So if you've got a timer
running, flip the phone over, and it shows this nice little
draining liquid animation to show your progress on that timer. Why would you do this over watching a countdown on the main display? I don't know, but looks cool. And then it also shows
me other ongoing stuff, like phone calls or music playback, and then I control them
from that back screen. Why would I do this on
the back screen instead of the main screen? I still don't really know, but looks cool. They even made this ridiculous retro handheld gaming case for the phone with real
buttons and a D-pad. So if you put that on
the back of the phone, it connects via Bluetooth, and it becomes a controller
to play these mini games on that back screen. I can't believe they actually
made and sold this. Now why? Why would anyone wanna play
games on the tiny back display with two huge camera
cutouts poking through it instead of actually some
real impressive games on that awesome main screen? I still don't know and I
probably wouldn't do it, but nostalgia really
does some crazy things to some people's brains. But really I bring up all
this just to highlight that this is clearly the
most well thought out, most complete version of
this screen on the back idea that I think we've ever seen. Like I said, we've seen it before. We saw Xiaomi do it with that 11 Ultra, but we also saw the Nothing Phone 3, which did that dot matrix thing, which was kind of useful sometimes, or even the ROG Phone 9 for that matter, but none of them quite past the
threshold of gimmick for me. This back screen really
has me taking more selfies than I ever thought I would in my life, just because of how good the cameras are, and the fact that they've done it all with basically no drawbacks,
that's the other thing, like it's edge to edge,
it's corner to corner, it somehow doesn't disrupt
the weight distribution of holding the phone. And like I said, it's
lighter than the Pro iPhone. It's still IP68. You can dunk the whole thing
underwater if you want to. And it even has a screen
protector pre-installed on both the front and the back screen because, you know, you're
gonna put that phone down on some debris once in a while, and yeah, you could still
break it if you smash it, but so would a normal glass back anyway. So I'm impressed. I'm very impressed. I am bummed that I can't
use this phone as my daily, because like I said,
it's straight from China. This is a China version of it. And shout out to Dbrand for actually going and getting one in my hands, 'cause a lot of you were
tweeting at me to check it out. So I'm glad I did and I hope we can get
some more phones like this over in these parts 'cause
it's kind of embarrassing what it does next to the
stuff that we have available. Anyway, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace. ♪ Oh I can't get ♪","This phone is absolutely built around one-upping the iPhone.

2025-10-08,Google Pixel Pro Fold Review: Not Compatible!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl8RS0sR-qA,"(upbeat music) - So, I've been thinking about
this concept a lot lately. There's tons of folding phones out now, it's been a category for a little while and we're expecting a folding iPhone soon, it'll probably reinvigorate the category. And I actually don't think that the concept of a Pixel, and the concept of a folding phone are actually really compatible, and that's okay. (upbeat music) (calm music) So, hear me out, the idea of a Pixel is very specific, like we've seen it for
the past couple years now. It's a super smart phone, like it's never really been a super high-end piece of hardware, it's never had the best screen, or the best chip, or the best battery, or the best cameras, but just a ton of great clever software that the everyday person can appreciate and more often lately than ever, also a pretty good deal. But then the idea of a folding phone, well, this is inherently niche, like this is gonna be a premium priced, premium built piece of
bleeding edge hardware for the people that want the
absolute most from their phone. They use their phone so much they have two different
styles of phone in one and it might cost $2,000 to get that. So, Pixel and folding phone are like opposites, they're at odds with each other. But that didn't stop
Google for making another nearly $2,000 folding phone. And so I've been using it and as someone who really likes Pixels and as someone who likes folding phones, I like it. But I do understand that
there are very few people who I can recommend this to. So, the biggest change versus
last year's Pixel Fold, no joke, is the new hinge. It's been re-engineered so there are both aesthetic
and functional improvements. It's now gearless, and it's much smaller. So now the bezel to the left of the cover
screen is much thinner and it's closer to even
all the way around, and it has this nice smooth motion, a satisfying kind of heavy resistance. It's a nice hinge. Shout out to the hinge engineers. The hingeneers I guess. So, this makes room for the next best thing about this phone, which is these new displays so you can maybe already tell this outside cover display
is a little bit bigger, it's 6.4 inches, and it's also a good amount brighter. One of my favorite trends
in phones this year so 3000 knits is the new max and it looks really good in
basically any conditions. Then you open it up and the inside eight inch
screen is brighter too. Now, not much else is different. It still has a selfie camera
cut out in the corner. It still has that
aggressively medium bezel all the way around, and it still has that very
visible crease through the middle that you can easily feel with your finger, but you kind of learn
to live with over time. So, then the next best
thing about this phone is probably Pixelsnap. So, the magnets in the back that they've added to every Pixel to give them Qi2 wireless charging, but also have them snap to literally any MagSafe accessory, elite. It's awesome. They made some of their own
Pixelsnap accessories of course, but the fact that every
Pixel 10 in the lineup can snap to the MagSafe charger, or a dock, or anything you can buy right now or might already have is so dope. And even though this folding
Pixel is a bit heavier than the average phone, it does still stay up in the car dash, no problem. That was one of my concerns coming in. There are also some other tiny changes like the sim card tray,
which is still here, has moved up to the top of the phone. And you can also now go up
to a terabyte of storage. Now, we already learned
that this Tenser G5 chip, which is new for this generation, was kind of a let down power-wise. Like it's nowhere near the most powerful chips
in phones right now. But they did pair it with 16 gigs of ram because it's a multitasking foldable so that makes sense. So yeah, I was let down
by the power levels, but I would say I was pleasantly surprised by the battery life and the efficiency because the battery life of this phone was actually really solid. Effectively, when you're
using it closed a lot, it's like a slightly thicker phone with a relatively small 6.4 inch display, and it's a 5,015 mAh battery. So, using it like that, I was getting like six
hours of screen on time, no problem every single day. Of course, mileage varies pretty directly with the amount of time you spend unfolded where it can chew through battery faster. But there is no question
that the extra room inside thanks to the thinner hinge was put pretty directly towards battery and it turns out to be a
surprising strength of this phone. Worth it. Shout out again to the hingeneers. Also, did I mention this
is the first foldable ever to be fully IP68 water and dust resistant. You better believe that's
also because of that hinge. So, using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold closed, it's pretty good. Everything I liked about
Pixel 10 is still here. It's all the Android 16 features, the Material 3 Expressive
aesthetics and the animations, and then all the AI features, Call Screening, Now Playing, all of that, super smart smartphone. Plus the new longer
battery life like I said. So, then opening it up just like every other foldable, I get inspired to be way more productive. Like I start doing things I would never do normally on a phone, like organizing travel,
buying plane tickets, and doing things side by side like email triage with schedule
building on my calendar. Like I just get this itch to crush my to-do list and be productive 'cause I have all this real estate now. There isn't anything
particularly new or special about Android on this folding screen. Of course there's still side by side apps, and the task bar and
doc thing at the bottom, but after that, it feels like it's really
just what you make of it. But also surprise, this Pixel is clearly still not a hardware leader in any way. Like it's still kind of
a chunky foldable phone, which is very noticeable when compared to a lot of these newer ultra thin folding phones. And it's also noticeably heavier. So, the slightly uncomfortable feeling that you get while using the phone closed, which let's be real, is how you're gonna be using it a lot, that's important. And so you could argue that that is a sacrifice that's necessary for such good battery life, but I just think the
ergonomics are right up there on top of the list for
most important things about a foldable. And this isn't like a
silicon carbon battery or anything that charges
particularly fast either. And so the newer foldables
just feel more pleasant to use, even when open too. The lighter weight makes a difference, the thinner bezels make a difference, the lesser creases on other foldables makes a difference too. This is also essentially the exact same cameras as last year, which is to say almost flagship quality. Like it's just a half step
down from the Pixel flagships despite how big this camera plateau is. So, just have a little less
detail and a little more noise and a little less ability and
low light shooting scenarios. And the 10 megapixel
selfie cameras on the cover and inside screens are just not that great at all, unfortunately. And then the Tensor G5
is decently efficient, like I said, and using the phone has been smooth and I have no complaints
with regular everyday use, but this doesn't hold a candle to the Snapdragon 8 Elite
for the most powerful stuff. Or it's about to get replaced by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. I don't know why it's called that, but still. So, the point is, in the competitive $2,000
price segment for smartphones, like people rightfully
start shopping a lot and expecting the absolute
max from their phone, especially with the hardware. And this phone, while it is really nice to use, I enjoy it, and it gets a lot of things right, it's pretty clearly not
giving you the absolute max especially with the hardware. Here's another way of looking at it, this is a really good phone in a vacuum, but we're not in a vacuum, so you have to consider the other options that are really exciting and really pushing the limits and then you start to compare it and notice other things that are great about those other phones. I'll keep using this one though. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys on the next one. Peace. (calm music)","I love using this phone, but also Pixel and foldable are opposites.

2025-10-01,iPhone 17 Review: No Asterisks!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rng_yUSwrgU,"[Music] [Music] Hey, hey, welcome to Honesty Wireless. World's most honest salesman here. How can I help you look familiar? You are You're the guy who bought the iPhone 16, aren't you? Yep, that was me. Told you not to do it. >> You did. You sure did. Yeah. So, what brings you back? Need more perfectly honest advice? Well, I actually have good news and bad news. So, bad news is uh I I broke the 16E. I sat on it. It's a goner. Don't worry about it. Cuz the good news is I won the lottery. Oh. Oh. Oh my god. Yeah. Pretty sick. Now, keep it on the DL. You know, I'm not telling anybody, but I'm telling you because I can now buy whatever phone I want. Money, no object. Oh, okay. Yeah, great. Money, no object. Yeah, it's happening. I'm the dream customer for you right now. I will literally buy whatever phone you tell me to. Just I want one of the iPhones. So, what's it going to be? Okay. Wow. Yeah. So, you you should order an iPhone 17. Not the 17 Pro. Nope. Just 17. So, so not the pro. >> Not the pro. >> No, I don't think you're understanding. I can spend all the money. I just I I'll do whatever. Like, I just want the best one for me. I hear that. But you want the best purchase and you still like higher refresh rate and you still want Mag Safe. Yeah. And you're coming from a 16e. Yeah. All true. But you don't want people to know you won the lottery. Also true. Okay. So, I mean, you could spend $2,000 on a brand new two TB 17 Pro Max in orange, but you could also just buy the 17 and use it the exact same way that you were going to. Yeah, that's Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. Uh, check out's right over here. [Music] You know, there's this funny thing that happens when the cheapest phone in a lineup of phones is a really good deal. It makes all of the more expensive versions feel like worse deals because they are. And this is the best base iPhone since they added the Pro to the lineup. And I don't think it's particularly close. Now, any smart company selling both a premium phone and a cheaper phone will do everything in their power to keep them as not overlapping as possible, which means there's always been one or two major features that the Pro has that it feels like the nonpros would never get. But this year, they just went ahead and added all the stuff we thought they should. And they didn't halfass that stuff either. So, first and foremost, they finally gave it a top tier display. It's brighter up to 3000 nits. It looks great outdoors. And most importantly, it finally has a variable refresh rate up to 120 Hz, which I love, and down to one herz minimum for efficiency. So, not only can we finally say goodbye to the $800 60 Hz iPhone, but it also now enables things like the always on display if you're into that. And it's also added PWM dimming. It may be buried in the accessibility settings, but that's a welcome addition, too. So, this is a super responsive, very bright, highquality display with really thin bezels. Dare I say a flagship quality display finally. This screen is also protected by the new ceramic shield 2. But then buried in this display up in this little cutout that hasn't changed in size is something genuinely new and interesting to the point where I think basically everyone else should copy it. It's the new selfie camera. Apple is calling it center stage, which I guess makes sense, but also the rest of their center stage cameras kind of sucks. I kind of wish they didn't use that. But either way, essentially, Apple's using a huge new 24 megapixel square selfie camera. So, when you go to take a selfie, you can take either an 18 megapixel horizontal crop or an 18 megapixel vertical crop. And it makes so much sense. It's like you go in to take a normal vertical selfie and it looks exactly the way you expect it to, but if a bunch of other people enter the frame and it becomes clear you're taking a group selfie, it automatically switches to a horizontal selfie without you having to rotate the phone at all. You can obviously do this manually if you want to, but that's already awesome. And the actual quality of the selfies are also topnotch. I think noticeably better than even the best from last year's 16 Pro. Another nice benefit though is selfie videos. Since there's way more sensor around the outside of the frame you're using, it can use that extra information for way better stabilization. And so even without any sort of action mode or special settings being turned on, the walk and talk videos I took from the selfie camera also look much smoother thanks to the EIS having all that extra information to play with. So this new selfie camera is across all the new iPhones in the lineup, the base, the Air, and the Pros. I think it's kind of genius and I think everyone should copy it and I think they probably will. So, better display, better selfie camera, and then to round out the trio of obvious improvements that everyone will like on a new phone, better battery. And again, actually, every new iPhone this year has a physically larger battery than the previous year. The base iPhone didn't get as much of a capacity jump as the Pro phones did, but it did also just get that more efficient variable refresh rate display instead of being locked at 60 Hz all the time. So yeah, you can save battery by dropping down to one herz for always on display and for not scrolling, just looking at photos and things like that. So it is actually getting a meaningfully longer battery life than the last gen. Nothing drastic, but I love having 5 hours of screen on time. And it charges noticeably faster, too. And the whole thing, it's all powered by the new A19 chip, which isn't the Pro, but it's still literally one of the most powerful single core chips on the planet right now and has a ton of headroom for the future. But then the icing on the cake is that they doubled the base storage from 128 to 256 gigs, which that that's where all the price comparisons start coming in because if you were going to upgrade storage tiers anyway, that makes every model of the phone feel like a 100 bucks cheaper. So dare I say, the new iPhone 17 is just a straight up good deal now. No asterisks, no ifs, ands, or buts, just this phone is actually a good deal. Like, hear me out. The Pixel is usually considered a pretty good value, right? This year, the Pixel 10 base, 256 gigs, is $900. So, that means this base iPhone has a better screen, a better main camera, a better selfie camera, a better battery life, and a way more powerful chip with more headroom, and and just one less telephoto camera for a hundred bucks less than the equivalent Pixel. That's kind of crazy. It's now this like rock solid default phone for most people. So, it's great, but it's not perfect. No phone's perfect. It just definitely feels a lot more like the complaints that I have about this phone are more minor where previous generations there were major missing features. So, like the new selfie camera, I really want to be able to record the whole square sensor if I want to, but you can't, at least with the stock camera app. I think it may be possible with some third party apps in the future, but you would think if Apple's working on a foldable, which will most likely have a large squareish display on the inside, maybe it wouldn't be insane to let people shoot big square selfies. Something to think about. Or there's also this new dual capture feature in the camera, which lets you shoot out front and back cameras at the same time. And it's nothing we haven't seen before, but Apple adds this nice little motion blur when you move the front camera feed around the frame, which is cool. looks smooth, but once you record, it's baked in. And I think it would have been way more cool if you could continue to move that camera feed around after you record. Like maybe you realize you're blocking an important part of the frame or something, but you can't. Also, USB 2.0 data transfer speeds are still sad for moving big files off of this phone, but since you can't shoot ProRes videos to the base iPhone, I suppose you probably aren't doing that nearly as often with this device. and no telephoto camera in a price bracket where a lot of phones do actually still have telephoto cameras, which can be very useful. And maybe most glaringly obviously, no real improvements to Apple Intelligence still in the last couple months for any of the iPhones. But that's really about it. And a few of those things can be updated with software updates eventually if they want to get to that stuff. But yeah, most of my complaints complaints with the iPhone 17 are minor. The design obviously really didn't change at all since the 16, which means it's still matte all the way around the back and the sides, which I like. It's still IP68, water and dust resistant. It also still rocks a bit on a table because of the corner cameras, and it still has the camera control button, which Apple was suspiciously quiet about in all of their keynotes and presentations and videos involving the camera. It's giving me 3D Touch vibes. Like, I actually wouldn't be totally shocked if it quietly disappeared in 2 years. I kind of hope it doesn't. But yeah, there are also new colors, and it's one of the nicest lineups as far as colors we've seen in a bit. But anyway, the effect that I talked about earlier in the video is even more true now than ever before, which is when the base phones in a lineup of phones is really good, when it's a really good deal, it makes the pros, the more expensive ones, harder to justify. And that's a problem other smartphones have had to deal with in the past. And that's never been more true about the iPhones. This 17 is really good. Why would you spend $300 extra dollars for a Pro? What are you getting out of that? You get the vapor chamber and the telephoto camera. And the more I thought about it, the more I think it actually means the Pro phones are actually appropriately named because the things you're getting out of those phones now for spending that extra money are a little smaller things that really only pros are going to notice or need. like the Pro chip with the better GPU and improved sustained thermal performance thanks to a vapor chamber. Most regular use of a smartphone is bursty and very on and off. But, you know, the pros might be gaming for a while or recording long video sessions. And the Pros also have a LAR emitter for autofocus and a telephoto camera and just generally higher quality cameras and more manual and hightouch camera features like ProRes RAW video stuff that regular people aren't touching. So outside of that, if you're not literally a pro, if you're not doing a bunch of gaming or a bunch of long video captures, then there are very few convincing reasons to spend the extra $300 on the Pro phone. People will still do it, but I think this is the phone most people should get. Yeah, I'm okay with that. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

2025-09-26,iPhone 17 Pro Review: Paradox in a Box!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0aFOxT6TNw,"- The best thing about the iPhone Air is actually how much it
seems to have freed Apple up to make the Pro phones even more pro. (slow dramatic techno music) (slow dramatic techno music continues) (slow dramatic techno music fading) Have you noticed that? These new Pro phones are
thicker than last year, more room inside for bigger batteries, and a vapor chamber, and a bigger camera. It's not quite on the
level of the Ultra phones, but this is the most maximalist that an iPhone has ever
felt, and I like it. But also, let me let you in on a little not-so-secret secret. The Pro phone is always
the best selling one. Like this year, the iPhone
Air is the most interesting and it's getting the most YouTube
clicks and the most views, but then the Base 17 is
more than ever the one that most people should
get and the best deal. But it turns out the
Pro Max, specifically, by far, is the most
popular, by sales numbers. I was gonna try to find a
way to show you guys this, you know, channel sponsor Dbrand, they make a accessory for
every single model of iPhone, and so their sales distributions
kind of match Apple's. And this is the distribution this year. Over half our Pro Maxes,
and between the two Pros, that's like 90% of orders. So yeah, it's fun to watch
Apple kind of walk this line between being a more pro
phone than ever before and this maximalist new design
and everything they're doing, but also, being literally
the most mainstream phone of all-time. Like the cameras. Might as well start there, right? The cameras are the most pro thing about the Pro iPhone every year. And on one hand, no professional
would say, ""Oh yeah, thank gosh I have eight
lenses now in my smartphone,"" like Apple seems to want us to believe. It clearly has three. But, the three cameras you get are more evenly matched than ever. The primary and ultra-wide
are essentially unchanged from last year, but the
telephoto gets a big update. It's now also a 48-megapixel camera and it's a 4X telephoto lens. Last year was a 5X but only 12-megapixels. So, this new one feels
like a more natural, portrait focal length. It's roughly a hundred
millimeter equivalent and all of your zoom shots
will have much more detail and much less noise, thanks to
the sensor being much larger and much higher resolution. Now, I will give them credit for the specific 2X zoom increments, because while they are
not actually new lenses, they do specifically process
each of the images shot in a 2X crop to be slightly
sharper and better looking than just a pure digital crop
on the middle of the sensor. So, you know, it's not the
level of a pure optical zoom, but it's better than nothing. So, I don't know why they only do it at these focal lengths, honestly. Either way, it's a really
nice total package now. Three matching 48-megapixel cameras, all of which are super reliable, just as good for casual
shooters as they are for people who depend on
their iPhone for work, or maybe who happen to have
an entire YouTube channel about cars that they happen
to shoot all on smartphones. (clears throat) Yeah. Electric G Wagon review
coming to ""Auto Focus"", shot on iPhone 17 Pro very soon. I do still kind of find myself wishing they made some other improvements, like the point light problem at night when you shoot in the dark and those little flares always show up. They haven't fixed that at all. Or even adding 8K video support. There's a two terabyte iPhone model now. I feel like 8K video is just
a flip of a switch away, but not this year. But you know, the changes
are stacked up nicely over the years from older Pro phones like the 13 Pro and the 14 Pro. It's not a huge difference
versus last year, but it's nice. Also, what you're watching
right now is ProRes raw footage from the iPhone 17 Pro, which I was particularly excited about because that means I can go
into the new Final Cut Pro 11.2, I think it is, and I
can literally change ISO and white balance after I
shoot, which is very useful. Also, the file sizes are huge. And there's even another
Pro feature that they added that they couldn't brand for themselves because pros already use it and named it, and that's genlock support, which basically lets
devices talk to each other so that they can stay in sync over large, multi-device shoots. Pretty sick. And also the selfie cameras
are more pro than ever more about that in the 17 Base review. But yeah, a lot going on with cameras. So let's be real, 95% of people who get these phones are
just gonna point and shoot and these are more capable and
reliable than ever for that. If you want more in-depth
stuff on shooting like professionally with this camera, you can check out Tyler Stalman's review, which I'll link below. It's really in-depth and
he shot the whole thing also on the iPhone. My favorite thing about
this new Pro iPhone though is actually the new design. It's not often that the newest
iPhones actually change a lot and get thicker and heavier, but like I said, I
think that's kind of one of the best things about them coming out with a separate phone that's
designed just to be super thin, so that if you want a thin
phone, go get the Air. But if you don't care about that, if that's not one of your priorities, then here's the new Pro, which goes the other
direction and isn't afraid of a few extra fractions of an inch. And I love that it's an all
uni-body metal jacket now. This is not a glass sandwich anymore. Literally, the whole body
of the phone is metal now with glass cutouts at the
back for wireless charging, and then at the top for those
millimeter wave antenna. This makes it more durable, it makes more room inside
for a bigger battery, which we'll get to in a second, and there's enough room
for a vapor chamber for the first time ever in an iPhone. And then the new plateau at the top, I actually think it's great. This is where I've been
putting my index finger on Android phones for years. It's like a natural resting
spot to hold up the phone. Same thing with this one now. And Corning's Ceramic Shield too, in case you haven't already
heard, is also clearly awesome for preventing scratches
to the front glass. A couple of nitpicks though,
no black color Pro phone? You sickos. This is like one of those weird things that it feels like Apple's
doing just spite me, where they're making a bunch of products that should have a
black version but don't. Like the new MacBook Airs come in silver, and starlight, and sky
blue, and dark blue. But no black? And then the AirPods
Max refresh also comes in a bunch of colors, and
dark blue, but no black. We need a dark neutral,
especially because the color that you pick actually shows up around the front bezel of the phone. So you see the color
you pick all the time. It makes the orange and silver that much more annoying to me. (sighs) I told you it was a nitpick. But then you've probably
also already seen the chatter about Scratchgate, which
is just how easily it seems like the anodization layer on top of the aluminum seems to scratch off and then reveal the raw
silver aluminum underneath it. And I kind of don't really
know what to make of this yet. I feel like this has come up before with a lot of darker
anodized aluminum phones. And as a person who rocks
the phone with no case, I haven't had any issues
with the one I'm using. I've been tossing it around. But the JerryRigEverything
test has revealed that the weakest part that
you could get scratched or dinged is gonna be around
the tightest corner radii, like around the camera plateau. So we'll see how many phones
this ends up affecting. But we gotta talk about
the insides of this phone because the redesign is one thing, but there's even more
going on under the surface. The A19 Pro chip,
shocker, is pretty great. It's benchmarked around 20%
faster than the last generation and when paired with iOS
26 and 12 gigs of RAM now, these phones feel really quick
and snappy, which is great. But the extra thickness has also made room for a vapor chamber for the first time, and it's actually made a real
difference to the thermals and the behavior of this phone. Big shout out to HGX Studio, YouTuber, who is able to put thermal
cameras on these phones under load and really visualize this, but especially compared to the Air, these phones rarely got any more than slightly warm to the touch for me. And as a result, they were able to actually hold higher frame
rates longer while gaming and keep the display brightness higher when recording videos for a long time. Check out the rest of his
video too, by the way. It's freaking incredibly well done. But, it also reminded me about
why, in the Android world, like gaming phones kind
of have the same effect. The stuff that makes a
gaming phone really good, like better speakers
and better performance, and better screen and big batteries, well, all that stuff is
awesome for regular use too. And it's the same deal for the Pro iPhone. The stuff that makes a
really good Pro iPhone, like the improved display,
and the much better cameras, and the thicker, better
build with improved cooling for shooting videos longer, and better sustained performance, yeah, it turns out the masses
buying iPhone 17 Pro Max also really enjoy nicer screens,
cameras, and batteries too. Not a surprise. And we've all been saying for years, ""Hey, just make a thicker phone
and put more battery in it."" I just really feel like
this is another place where having an iPhone Air
focusing on getting super thin, let them feel free to go
the total other direction with the other phones because if they're gonna
claim the iPhone Air is all-day battery life, then great, every single other phone in
the lineup gets even thicker with bigger batteries. So the 17 Pro has a 20%
bigger battery than last year, and the Pro Max actually cracks
the 5,000 milliamp hour mark for the first time ever,
which is great in iPhone land, and also 40 watt charging now. So that's half battery in 20 minutes. To Apple, that's a big deal. We welcome a 20%
year-over-year improvement. Now in Android land, obviously it's, it kind of looks like nothing, like it's nowhere near the Ultra phones with 6,000 milliamp hour
silicon carbon batteries and 100-watt charging and all that. But, for a phone that ships in the volume that the iPhone does, very
happy to see that sort of improvement when last year's phone already had really good battery. The iPhone is also very efficient. So I am getting a nice five plus hours of screen on time every day
on not even the bigger phone, and it's lasting all day
with 30+ percent left. So, I'm loving it. And then, there's just all sorts
of other little things too, like with this screen, I think this is the first
generation of iPhone that's had a toggle for PWM dimming. Now it's buried in the
accessibility settings, but you can search and find it, and that is very welcome to many people. And there's also a slightly noticeable but better-than-nothing
anti-reflective coating. But more importantly, the display gets slightly brighter now and I noticed that. It's up to 3000 nits peak. And satellite connectivity has
expanded to cover messaging and location sharing too
now, which is useful. So at the end of the day, the paradox is that making the Pro iPhones more pro is actually better for the masses. And this is the best one yet,
it's the most freed one yet. And I think, you know,
when they eventually, if they make some iPhone
Ultra at some point, I'll probably still want
all of that over this. But for now, this is good stuff. Now if you are thinking
about getting an iPhone 17 but you are concerned
about those scratches, then channel sponsor Dbrand
does have some options for you. Like this Grip Case, which
I have here in that black. And it also does a pretty good
job of hiding that plateau, which if you've seen
Zach's durability test, it is the most vulnerable spot for the anodization to chip off. Alternatively, if you're
more of a clear case person, you can grab one of their
Ghost Cases instead, which comes with a lifetime
zero yellowing guarantee and also a full camera protection. Fun fact, these are also available at Best Buy in the US now too. Both cases check all the boxes
you want in an iPhone case, like strong MagSafe and
camera control buttons. But most importantly, they're
both super protective. And then whichever way you go, if you wanna round out your protection with a screen protector,
you can also pick up one of Dbrand's Prism Protectors. They're super easy to install. And if you bundle it
with either a Grip Case or a Ghost Case, you can use
code M-K-B-H-D at checkout to save 42% on the Prism. Pretty sweet deal. I'll leave a link down below
for you to check 'em all out. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys very soon,
still in Techtember, in the next one. Peace. (light upbeat techno music)","The two-sided existence of the iPhone 17 Pro/Pro Max

2025-09-23,iPhone Air Review: Beauty is Pain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDARtYjUiHs,"- Every product design
(ethereal music) is a series of trade-offs. It's like a slider, where you can push it either towards form or towards function and it can be exciting when
you push it way towards form. (moves into magnificent music) This is the iPhone Air. So Apple decided to make a
ridiculously thin iPhone, yes. It's thinner than a number two pencil, thinner than any previous
iPhone that's ever been made, including the one that bent. It's thinner than the freaking iPod Touch. That is ridiculous. And this isn't simply
an iPhone shrunken down, Apple has done a ton of rearranging parts and pieces inside the phone. They've squeezed a lot
of the compute and memory and logic board up into
the top of the phone and allowed a bit of a bulge, which they're calling a plateau, which leaves most of the
slimmer bottom of the phone for just battery. The edges are nice and softly rounded, and the whole outside
frame is shiny titanium, which picks up a ton of fingerprints but also is remarkably durable. They 3D printed the USB type-C port to fit and all of the buttons and camera control, as thin as they are, go pretty much right up to the front and back edges of the phone. The end result is an iPhone
that is noticeably thinner and lighter than it's been in a long time. It is super impressive, and importantly, deserving of the Air name. But it's not perfect. (chuckles) Of course, it's not perfect. You wouldn't be watching this
review if it was that easy. There are a bunch of trade
offs to making it this thin. It doesn't just get this thin magically without a bunch of sacrifices. Beauty is pain after all. And so now that I've been using this phone for a couple of weeks, I'm just gonna give you
each of the trade offs that Apple made and how much
you'll actually notice them. And I have some small concerns, some medium concerns, and
then the big concerns. So small concern number one is they did remove the bottom
speaker to achieve this. So most of the bottom of
this phone is battery, but then those grills at the bottom of the Air are just for microphones. So the only speaker in this whole phone is up in that earpiece at the top. Couple things. A speaker that small is
not going to get as loud, but there's also way less bass. So things are a bit tinny. But the worst case scenario is actually when you turn your phone
landscape to watch a video or game or do something with stereo audio, in which case you'll probably
notice all of the audio is coming from one side of the phone. And if you accidentally block
that earpiece with your thumb, that's even more annoying. So the speakers are definitely not great, but they're acceptable
for most everyday use. At least they're not horrible, you kind of just get used to it. So then the iPhone Air
is eSIM only globally. This is, again, in an effort to make enough
room for the battery, they're just getting rid of the slot where you normally have a
little plastic SIM card. So this is a very direct
trade off to get more battery out of that safe space. Apple won't say exactly how
much battery they gained back, but some of the numbers
I'm starting to see pop up around the eSIM versus non-eSIM iPhones, looks like there's
around 200 milliamp hours of extra battery they're
getting out of this. And believe me, I'll talk more
about battery in a minute. But yeah, lots of people use
regular SIM cards to this day. And I guess it's a bigger deal to me, because I swap phones a lot
and there's lots of phones, from like Huawei and OPPO that I wouldn't be able
to get my SIM card into and doesn't work well with eSIM, so I really dislike it. But I suppose for the average person, they'll only notice this once or twice. Once when they switch the phone, and then once when they
move on to another phone. But speaking of carriers, the iPhone Air, unlike the rest of the iPhone 17s, does not support mmWave 5G. And the thing is, most
people outside of the U.S. have never used mmWave 5G, and most people in the U.S. have also never used mmWave 5G. So you know it's super
convenient once in a while. When you have it, you know,
I found myself near a hotspot with a supporting device and if I happen to have
something to download in that moment, it's great. But that is so rare and so
far between that you might as well not worry about it yet. The modem in the iPhone Air is brand new. It's the new C1X chip and alongside Apple's new
in-house designed N1 chip, which does all the networking, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6 and Thread, it's performed great. It does not seem to have
any weaknesses in speed or coverage versus Qualcomm iPhones, previous iPhones with other modems, so that's been great to see. But then the USB-C port
at the bottom of the Air is only USB2 transfer speeds. So, that's just dumb. But now let's get to the medium concerns. First of all, less cooling. Okay, so I did notice
this phone getting hotter. It's running the more
powerful A19 Pro chip with one less GPU core
than the Pro phones, but it's a Pro chip and the
Pro phones are way thicker and they're made of aluminum
for better thermal conductivity and they have a new vapor
chamber to draw heat away from that chip and dissipate
it through the body. The Air has none of that. And so I did have a few
instances, especially early on, where I was doing a lot
of the sustained activity and the back of the phone was
heating up a lot in my hands, especially like right
below the camera plateau. No question, it's gotta be
throttling down that chip with any sort of heavy, sustained use, it's a little concerning, but the phone never actually did overheat or give me an overheating message. So I guess that is a good thing. So then there is the single camera, and I'm putting this in medium concerns, but it really very much
depends on the person. For some it's just like, ""Are you cool with this or not?"" Because a lot of people, a lot of people, are currently using iPhones
that have more than one camera. Lots of older iPhones even
have that useful Ultra Wide. And most of the people
thinking about buying this Air have those second cameras,
even third cameras. And so the Air doesn't have an Ultra Wide, and I can't tell you how many times I went to go take a picture of something and then realized I can't
switch to the Ultra Wide. And there's also
obviously no zoom as well. I will say Apple makes a big deal about their processing pipeline for the 2x crops on the Fusion camera. So the middle 12 megapixels for a 2x photo having
a decent quality shot, but that still doesn't replace having an actual quality zoom camera. And that's especially noticeable
when you try to zoom in, I'd say anywhere past about 5x, the quality really starts to drop off in all shooting scenarios. All that said,
(shutter clicking) the one camera you do get is really good. It's essentially the same
as the base iPhone 17, and in the world of a
thousand dollars phones, it is right up there with the best. The selfie camera too, which I'll talk more about
in the base iPhone 17 review, genuinely innovative
and dramatically better than previous iPhones. I think casual photo and video takers will actually mostly be fine with this single camera
solution in a vacuum, but we're not in a vacuum and
there are other options out and you just have to know
that there are other phones that cost a thousand dollars that have way more capable
camera systems that can do zoom, that can do ultra wide,
that can do macros. This won't do that. So for me, someone who relies on the cameras on the phone a lot, this is one of the reasons I'm
not going to be switching to or dailying the Air, but for your parents or someone you know who
takes most of their photos and videos on the main
camera all the time anyway, they'll probably be
totally fine with this, and this was a carefully
considered cut from Apple to get there. But now my two main concerns
with the iPhone Air, and probably for most people, the durability and the battery, and some of this is
actually kind of shocking. It turns out the iPhone
Air is not just a survivor of the famous
JerryRigEverything bend test. It's literally one of the most impressively durable
smartphones of all time. I'm not exaggerating,
it's kind of ridiculous. I think in most people's concerns, when seeing a piece of hardware this thin, naturally they're thinking, ""Oh, am I gonna break this?"" ""Am I gonna snap it in half?"" And the answer it turns out
pretty definitively is no, this is not any less durable
than a normal smartphone. The titanium frame can
withstand more bending than any human can put
their mortal hands through, and it'll snap back to flat
even if you do get it to flex. And you can almost
undoubtedly sit on the phone for an extended period of
time, like an insane person, and it will survive. It's still IP68 water and dust resistant, dunk it underwater if you want to. And the Ceramic Shield
2 on the front and back is actually even more scratch resistant than previous versions. I know they say that a lot. ""Oh this one's the most
scratch resistant yet,"" but it's to the point where it didn't even
show the normal scratches at level six with deeper
grooves at level seven on Zach's famous test, it passed even beyond normal smartphones. Now of course, glass is
glass and glass still breaks. You could still drop this phone and shatter the front or
back glass, of course. But you know, I think we
all went into this thinking that the durability would be
a major weakness of this phone and it turns out it's one
of the biggest strengths, which is crazy. Turns out those engineers and material science people over there are actually pretty good
at what they're doing. Or maybe they had some incentive to not repeat a certain past incident. And then it also turns around and gets a 7 outta 10 from
iFixit for repairability and still retains dual entry
when you go in to repair it, so you can take just the front glass or just the back glass off and Apple posted all their
disassembly guides on day one. Kudos. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that through all my throwing it in a frizzy bag and tossing it on a chair next to me, and all the abuse I've
put this phone through, it hasn't even come close
to breaking or bending. So that brings us to the
last main concern, battery. So the battery on the
iPhone Air is pretty weak and there's no getting around that. Remember earlier this year though, when I said one of the big pillars of 2025 smartphones was
going to be these new, higher-density silicon carbon batteries? Well it turns out two of the biggest phone
manufacturers out there, Samsung and Apple, well, they just didn't wanna
take the dive on that quite yet on any of their phones. So not only is this
phone thinner than ever, with less room inside
for battery than ever, but it's also not even a
special, high-density battery to make up for it. So the result is this big, bright, gorgeous six and a half inch, 120 hertz OLED display being powered by a battery the same size
as the one in the iPhone 11. I will say parts have gotten
more efficient, right? So like the display can
throttle down all the way to one hertz and the A19 Pro chip can underclock super well. So it's not a disaster, but I'm giving the
battery about a C minus. Ending the day with like 15% left in Low-Power Mode in normal use with four hours of screen on time for a brand new phone is not that great. Makes me concerned for how this will look in three or four years down the road. It's actually kind of similar
to the camera situation. Like, there are lots of
people who are now, today, it might be you, using a
phone with a big battery that was awesome when you first got it. But now years later, if you're
getting to the end of the day and it's dying and you realize
you need a battery upgrade, the Air is probably not the
phone you should be getting. But if you are getting to year
three or four of your phone and the battery is not an issue and you feel like you're
a pretty light user, then the Air could be fine for you. So to be specific, for my own use, like standby time I
noticed was pretty good, like it is on so many other iPhones, but this Pro chip can
spike up pretty quickly. So even with like some screen off stuff like wireless CarPlay for example, it would take big chunks outta my battery. Anytime the phone was doing
anything heavy, battery beware. And then this phone also
charges slower than the rest of the 17 lineup, which
makes it even more annoying. So if you're a heavy user like me, well, you literally just end up keeping it on a wireless charger as much as possible. It's annoying, it was just
very annoying to be honest. And that's sort of the two things that made it a deal breaker for me is the cameras and the battery. The difference though
between those is the battery, you can kind of work around
it, the camera, kind of can't. Also pretty classic Apple
move to make the problem and then sell you the solution. So this is the MagSafe
battery they launched alongside the Air. It's sold separately for a hundred bucks, and it's also just to be honest,
not a very good accessory. It turns out it's basically
the exact same battery that's in the iPhone Air,
(graphics pop) but only charges it to about 65%, because of the heat loss
during wireless charging. Not a great deal. So originally I said there
were basically two ways to look at the iPhone Air. One is it's just Apple
trying something new, throwing it out the wall
to see if it sticks. Oh, maybe people like this or it is a long, premeditated
preview at the future of all smartphones when
they're all this thin. But I lied. There's actually a third
way to look at this phone, and that is as one half of
the upcoming foldable iPhone that we all expect as early as next year. Because it's easy to be impressed by the thinness of the iPhone Air, but if you've paid attention to the rest of the smartphone world lately, each half of a good folding phone is often even thinner than this iPhone. It's obviously a huge priority for them, because they're trying to
get to the same thickness as a normal phone when closed, so double their typical Z axis. So all of this work, all of
this incredible reorganization of the inside of the
phone and the components and the miniaturization of parts and the efficiency maxing with their in-house developed
parts like N1 chip and C1X, all of that effort is absolutely geared towards seeing if they can make the first ever, truly new
form factor of an iPhone, maybe since the 10,
one that folds in half. And it just so happens to enable this really
thin form factor Air phone that they'll make in the meantime. Kind of the exact same way we got a Galaxy S25 Edge and then a few months
later got the Z Fold 7, which was an ultra-thin
foldable from Samsung. So I'm very much looking forward to that crazy foldable
iPhone when it comes, and what they'll call it, and what software it'll run
and all that other stuff. But for now, this one,
yeah, it's an iPhone still. You know, every year we get the new iOS and all of its features
and the clear theme and visual intelligence
and all the iPhone stuff. And I review that separately and you guys already know
about all that stuff. And then we get the new
iPhones announcement, and there are almost zero
new actual features here other than the selfie camera. But now it's like I'm reviewing, you know, the box that iOS comes in, you know? And I think this package,
as cool as it is, like, this will speak to plenty of people. It's beautiful, it's super trim, it's super light in the
hand, which is underrated. People are gonna pick this phone
up and immediately love it. But I think maybe the best
thing about the iPhone Air is actually how much it
seems to have freed Apple up to make the Pro phones even more pro, which are now thicker
and have more battery and heavier and bigger cameras
and all unibody metal now. That's the one I'll be daily driving. Stay tuned for the full review, of course, on the Pro phones next. But hey, if you are planning
on picking up an iPhone Air or literally any other iPhone or any Android phone for that matter, then channel sponsor Ridge has it covered. And I know Apple made their
MagSafe wireless charger, but trust me, you'd rather
have Ridge's wireless charger. Because this power bank
is 10,000 milliamp hours. So that's good for about
three full charges. Plus, it can actually do other things so it can charge your Apple Watch. It has two built in cables,
USB type-C at 20 watts and Lightning for any
legacy Apple devices. And it even has a kickstand
built in to pop up your phone and watch videos while you're charging. It comes in Matte Black, Matte Olive, or Basecamp Orange to match your style. So whether you're
upgrading to the iPhone Air or literally grabbed any other new phone that Ridge power bank has you covered. So check it out today at

2025-09-19,Wait... Smart Glasses are Suddenly Good?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gtc1DW2Tgo,"(intriguing music) - All right, so I'm in the middle of reviewing these new iPhones, which are pretty interesting, but you know, they're new iPhones so they're iterative. And then Meta of course decides to also have an event
'cause it's Techtember and things just don't stop. So I put that down for a second. I fly back out to California, and what Meta has to show me is actually shockingly advanced. Because just 10 months ago, I saw this, I made a whole video about it. These are Meta's Orion
AR glasses prototypes, which were super cool and overlaid software
onto the world around you. But they can never sell these things because the materials
alone cost like 10 grand, and they're a bit too cumbersome, and they have a whole separate stick with a computer in it that's nearby, and they overheat, and the battery lasts like an hour. It was a cool proof of concept of a bleeding-edge technology but not a real product. Now here we are 10 months later, and they're handing me a finished product with a price tag and a release date. And it's these, the Meta Ray-Ban Display, clever name, I know, but it's essentially an updated version of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's massively better
than the Orion prototype. Now the main difference with these is these are a monocular display, meaning it's only showing up in one eye, the right eye, and it's fixed slightly lower and to the right of the
middle of your vision, but it's still full color, plenty sharp, 42 pixels per degree to be exact, and more than bright
enough to be seen outdoors. I tried these things outdoors, gets up to 5,000 nits. So it's like a real-life little HUD in the corner of your vision that you can turn on or off at any time, and you still control everything through a neural band on your wrist that uses surface EMG technology to read the electrical impulses going through your arm as you make different gestures that you pretty quickly memorize and can draw discreetly and quietly with pretty good accuracy. You can scroll up, scroll down, select, you can go forward and backward, and even turn up and down volume by pinching in the air
and twisting slowly. And as I'm getting to try these, I just keep thinking, ""The rate of improvement
is kind of insane."" For example, the light leak you might remember from Orion was very evident. Like you could see clearly when someone was looking at something when they were activated
with the Orion glasses. Now when I pull something up on the display in these, it's basically invisible
to the outside world. The light leak is nearly completely gone. Now of course this is a
much smaller field of view, but it's pretty impressive that from most angles there is virtually no way to see that I'm looking at something on the screen in these glasses. Even with the perfect angles, when the light hits just right, all you can really tell
is that these glasses do have a waveguide in them and I seem to be looking
off to the side a little bit and not directly at you, and that's it. And for the neural band, the controls have gotten even
more refined and precise. So back when I tried it 10 months ago, it was pretty good. But you know, the idea of doing text input by just drawing letters
in midair with your hand was just an idea. Now it's an actual feature, and it's maybe the most reliable, quickest method of text input that I've tried with these. It's absolutely insane. I was writing whole sentences first try, quickly, with no errors. It was nuts. There's also no separate computer
puck necessary for these, like there was with the prototype. Everything is self-contained
in the glasses, which are admittedly
definitely kind of thick, you know, a little less
crazy than the Orions, but you can still tell
there's some stuff going on with these if I walk by wearing them. And they weigh 69 grams. Nice. So just as a non-glasses wearer, they are a little bit heavy, like they're just heavy enough to not forget that I'm wearing them, but they're not super
cumbersome in my opinion. And of course you cannot underestimate how much aesthetics matter if you're gonna be wearing
this computer on your face. Like there needs to be
some element of ""fashion."" And I think they look better in person than they do on camera. And there's also two colors,
either black or sand, and they actually come with a
matching-colored neural band, black or sand as well. Oh, and the charging case. The charging case is also pure genius. It can either hold the glasses inside or you take them out and it folds down flat in like two seconds and still has enough room for
four more charges of battery. This did not get enough attention for how awesome it was, because it came in the middle of a keynote that was kind of an absolute disaster in so many other ways. But I'm impressed with the charging case. Now here's the thing, these Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been out for like four years now and they have been a hit actually. They let you talk to Meta's AI and send messages with your voice and listen to music. But I'm fairly confident that the number-one use of these by far is to use the built-in cameras to record POV videos. So the real question
you might be asking is, ""All right, Marques, what does adding a
display into the glasses actually get you?"" And I was thinking the same thing. I'm glad you asked, because
I have the answers now. So number one, first and foremost, you can obviously see
the UI of the glasses instead of just relying
entirely on voice commands. So if you wanna do something in the UI with the gestures and never
speak a word out loud, that's advantage number
one to having a screen. Number two is you can actually see the viewfinder of the camera now, so you can be very sure of
exactly what you're capturing and you can review pictures and videos after you've taken them. That's also pretty useful. Number three, messaging
and even video calls on your glasses are pretty sick. So if you're in a video call, you can see the person you're talking to and the person on the other end just sees a feed from your
forward-facing camera, just straight POV. Then number four, maps, which I think are pretty killer. I've talked about it with Google Glass. If you go to navigate somewhere, you can open up the maps and then get turn-by-turn directions and a rotating map that
tracks with your head to match the direction you're facing, which to someone like me with a terrible sense of
direction is so clutch. And then number five is subtitling basically anything you
want in the real world. It uses the beamforming microphones to specifically listen to
whatever's in front of you and then put that live text on the HUD of exactly what they're saying. And it works pretty quickly. And if that speech is in another language, it should be able to
live translate everything for you to understand what they're saying. Again, so clutch, and this is all being
wrapped into a real product that you can buy this year with a real price tag that is $800, which yeah, it's expensive, it's the price of a whole phone, but it's actually a
little bit less expensive than I maybe would've guessed before actually hearing that. I wouldn't be surprised if Meta is actually losing money
on the hardware here in an effort to just get them out and get 'em into people's hands. But that also conveniently brings us to maybe the biggest downside
of this particular product, which is that it is Meta. And that's not a disaster. I mean, obviously people already like the Meta Ray-Bans already, but it also does mean you still will have the privacy questions of exactly what data's being collected and what they do with it. And then the other thing,
I dunno if you noticed, but every app that you
use on these glasses is strictly first-party stuff. Like messaging with your
friends, that's WhatsApp. Video calls on the glasses,
that's also WhatsApp. That's not Google Maps, it's
their own mapping service, which I can guarantee won't have the best real-time traffic info or ratings like Google Maps has. And they'll even let you
scroll through Instagram Reels because Meta owns Instagram. The only exception I saw to this rule was the music playback was done through a partnership with Spotify. But as of right now, or at launch, there is no app store for these. It's coming allegedly, but not yet. But overall, though, I just can't help but be super impressed with how quickly they have
been moving forward with this. Like I said, less than a year ago was that crazy prototype with the separate computer and the $10,000 bill of sale. And now here we are, it's just, it's moving so quickly. And I know we're expecting other entries into the smart-glasses space probably within the next couple months, I think from Samsung and from Google and maybe some others. But as of right now, these are the best smart glasses with a screen that I've tried, hands down. And you know, the sad thing is you wouldn't really get that from the presentation at all. The keynote was so brutal, mainly because so many of the live demos that they tried went about as poorly as they possibly could have. I mean, I watched it live. If you get to watch that back, you'll know what I'm talking about. And it's unfortunate because the product is so cool, and I gotta give them props for trying to do real demos instead of faking everything, I guess. But yeah, this isn't gonna
be convincing anyone. - What do I do first? - [AI] You've already
combined the base ingredients, so now grate a pear to add to the sauce. - What do I do first? - [AI] You've already
combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear
and gently combine it with the base sauce. - All right, I think the
Wi-Fi might be messed up. - [AI] Pause WhatsApp video call. - There we go. (notification chiming)
Uh-oh. Well, let's see what happened there. (notification chiming)
That's too bad. I don't know what happened. The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the Wi-Fi on the
day kind of catches you. - So yeah, there's a
distinct lack of good videos of people using this tech
and these headsets right now. But I'm predicting that when
these actually do come out in a few weeks, that we're gonna see a
pretty significant wave of all this new content of the cool stuff people
get to do with this from the live-captioning to the maps to the AI stuff that it's
capable of, all at once. People are just gonna
start flooding the internet with content about it. But yeah, seeing how fast
these improved really actually for the first time in a while, it got me thinking about
if it could bring us closer to a post-smartphone world, which is obviously still super far away. These still need a smartphone
to connect to, to work. But you know, imagine a world where you're walking
around on a scenic hike and you see a cool scene and instead of taking your phone out and putting a computer
between you and the scene, you just, you know, snap
the picture on your glasses and just appreciate it. Seems nice, right? Then again, would you
rather be talking to someone and see them check their phone or their smartwatch real quick, and it's kind of rude,
but then they're over it? Or you're talking to someone who's maybe wearing some glasses like this and every once in a while
they just kind of glance down and to the right a little bit while they're talking to you and it's subtle, but you don't know if they're actually paying attention to you or not. Something to think about. Anyway, thanks for watching. Catch you very soon in the next one. Peace. (intriguing music)","Trying the Meta Rayban Display glasses

2025-09-17,iPhone 17/Pro/Air Unboxing: 1 Hot Take!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0EbxhQYeCA,"[Music] All right. So, by the time you watch this, I will be several days into my iPhone 17 series testing. So, definitely get subscribed to see the full reviews right when they come out. They're in the works. Uh, but I always like to do each year a bit of an unboxing and like a second look at the new phones outside of the very chaotic environment that is the hands-on area at Apple Park. and answer some FAQs and do some benchmarks and get some photo samples in and just get familiar with these phones. So, that's what we're gonna do. I've got the iPhone 17 Pro Max. This is actually the two terabyte, the $2,000 most expensive iPhone you can buy this year, a 17 Pro in the new blue color. So, I got the two new colors. Uh the green 17 and they put the phone sideways for the Air because it's the thin one. It's also the thinnest box. And I also have that Air battery that uh is a bit of a red flag, but we're going to look at it anyway. So, let's start with the base one, the iPhone 17. The experiences with these phones, unboxing them is typically the same from year to year. Uh but I do like to just check just to make sure. This base iPhone, I really am thinking is potentially the best deal they've had in the lineup in a long time. Uh, this green color. I actually kind of really like the green. You get this like glossy with the camera bump. And then the actual phone is satin even though it's not a pro phone. So, I'm loving that. You do get that USBC cable braided in the box. And then you get some paperwork. You don't get any stickers with iPhones. You know, that's that's the days of the past. But you still do get your uh you don't need a SIM card tray and uh a little bit of instructions, but that's basically it. There's nothing else that comes with these phones anymore. It's extremely minimal. Let's do the pros. The pros should be pretty similar, but I do want to look at these colors in my own lighting environment. I think the orange has proved to be the most controversial new color. I I've only seen takes of people either hating on it or loving it. I think I kind of like it, but I also kind of liken it to like a bright shirt. You know, it looks good on me in the moment, but I might not want to wear it every single day. You know, like the most popular car color is probably silver or black for a reason. Uh people want a black or a neutral color for their phone, too. But Apple's not giving it to us for the Pro phones this year. So, you have this really bright two-tone orange. I I thought it was going to be more pumpkin colored from all those leaks, but it is definitely not. It is fully orange. And then you've got this blue, which is is maybe the one I'm going to have to go with because it's the closest to black. A lot of people like the silver, and that's cool. Uh, I just can't I I record a lot of videos of things with screens and windows like cars and it's just too bright in the reflections. So, I have to use a dark colored phone. Probably going to end up debranding a blue pro phone. So, all right, that leaves the uh the new one, the ultra thin one, which is the iPhone Air. Notably, not the iPhone 17 Air, it's the iPhone Air. Uh, at least that's the way they said in the keynote, which is interesting because people are speculating that they may not refresh it every single year, which I guess logically could make sense, but I kind of think they're going to do a new one every year. But this is the thinnest box. They show it sideways on the box. Let's see what it actually looks like here. It's face up. Jeez. Every time you hold it. Okay, so this is the light blue, barely blue phone, and that is again just so ridiculously thin. Uh I think this is the third thinnest phone I've ever seen. I think there was the Moto Z, which was a few ten of a millimeter thinner, and then there's this one other phone I think was like 4 mm or something crazy that I never held. This is absolutely ridiculous uh to see and hold in person. And let's see if the packaging is any different. USBC cable like we expected. And yeah, paperwork's the same. Nothing special in the airbox other than your ultra thin phone. And yeah, this is the battery. So the battery, like we saw in the keynote, was launched alongside the phone. And it's designed for iPhone Air. And this is what it looks like here. this all-white battery. Uh, I checked on the back 3,149 milliamp hours, which by itself like this, that's the size of a normal small phone's battery. Uh, and then it pops on the back of the phone just like that. So, when I say designed for the Air, it's perfectly fitting underneath the camera bump. And you could use it on the other phones, but it's not designed for them. So, like it wouldn't really fit or magnetize in the right place. you'd have to, I don't know, use it sideways or something, which is probably not what you actually want to do. So, yeah, definitely made for this phone. There's nothing stopping other people like Ridge from making really good power banks that fit on any of the phones, but yeah, they launched these things together. And so, uh, yeah, I will be testing battery life thoroughly to figure out exactly what we're working with here. But that's the boxes. Nothing too shocking here, but there are plenty more first impressions to get to. So, I'd like to get benchmarks out of the way in these early impressions videos. So, here's the results from the new A19 and A19 Pro versus last generation. They take some pretty nice steps up again, especially in multi-core CPU and GPU. And there's also more RAM in these Pro phones now. It turns out last year it was 8 gigs across the board. This year, the Pros get 12. But while we're on numbers, this is one of those big things that's come out since the keynote. Uh battery size capacities. Apple doesn't advertise them, but you can find them. So, check this out. On the base iPhone, it's less interesting. These phones are nearly the same dimensions, and the batteries inside are also almost the same size, less than 5% bigger. The Pro phones are more interesting, though, because they've reworked the insides again. And these phones are also literally thicker than last year. And they're really feeling like the most maximalist iPhones yet. And that has translated into the battery department because the Pro Max has cracked 5,000 mAh for the first time. And the smaller sized Pro phone sees the biggest improvement. Nearly a 20% larger battery year-over-year in iPhone land. That's kind of a lot. It's worth paying attention to. And then maybe the most interesting phone, the Air. So, okay, it has a 3,149 millah battery. It is the smallest of the bunch as expected, but okay, 3100 milliamp is maybe slightly more than we expected once you see and feel how thin this phone really is. It's about the same size as the battery from the 13 Pro. What I will say is this this adds definitely more fuel to the I don't really know if I can believe anything Apple says about battery fire for me because uh on the the website to compare all devices if you look at batteries they rate the Air for more battery than last year's 16. They rate this for 27 hours and they rate last year's iPhone 16 for 22. To me that just means the Pro chip that's in here is more efficient for video playback. great. Uh, but real world use is more varied and there's way more going on with it. So, I guess all that to say, I will be paying a lot of attention to the battery life of this phone as I use it. It has so far been acceptable, but not great. I would say I had one really bad day early, but it was still downloading all my shiny new Spotify lossless audio. So, you kind of can't really count that. And since then, it's been trending towards around 4 and 1/2 hours of screen on time per day, which used to be good, but these days that's like C minus level. I'm glad it's not Fle, but stay tuned for my full review to get the verdict on that. But the Air really has been the most interesting iPhone in the lineup to test by far. It's the only one that's sticking with this titanium for the rails, which are very glossy and very quickly get covered in fingerprints. Uh, and I don't know if you can tell on camera, but this is also the blue one. You wouldn't know it just from the footage, but this it is in fact slightly blue. But I just feel like with the liquid glass elements of iOS 26 and the shiny rails, it kind of feels almost like a piece of jewelry, if that makes sense. It's just it's pretty stunning to hold. It's nice to look at, and it reminds me of the Galaxy Tab Ultra series with just how impressive it is that something this thin can have such a good-look display on the front of it. Matter of fact, speaking of Samsung, this is their ultra thin phone, the S25 Edge. And so now that they both exist, we can actually compare these two incredible pioneers of thinness, as I know so many people on social media will. Who did thin better? Now, I will say they do have a lot of similarities in their approaches to getting this thin. Both actually use the flagship chip from their lineups, or at least close to it. The iPhone Air does drop a GPU core from the A19 Pro, but the S25 Edge uses the full-on Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. Both also certainly sacrifice long-term cooling of this flagship chip by leaving out the vapor chamber from their bigger flagship brothers. But also, the S25 Edge has a full flagship main camera. The iPhone Air does not. The S25 Edge also has an ultrawide alongside it. The iPhone Air does not. S25 Edge still has stereo speakers. iPhone Air does not. There's no speaker at the bottom at all. That's just microphones. An S25 Edge has the smallest battery of the lineup, but it's still 3900 mAh, which is close to the base phone. iPhone Air has the smallest battery in the lineup by a bigger margin. But the iPhone Air is thinner. I personally lean S25 Edge just a bit just cuz on the surface level, I prefer I like cameras, so I prefer having a better camera system. And I think I like this boxier design a little bit better. But there's no question in my mind this is the most interesting iPhone of this lineup because of the thin thing and it will get a lot of people checking it out in stores and when they hold a friends and and when they just see it in public just cuz it looks that stunning. But I actually think that's a distraction because the base iPhone this year is more clearly than ever the one that most people should get. And this is a maybe that's a hotter take that I I dropped a little bit earlier on the Waveform podcast, so you might have heard this already if you listen there, but I think this is one of the best deals in all of smartphones. Like, think about this. You've you've seen in the past few years, the base Pixel has been a pretty good deal right now. The base iPhone 17, it has one less camera, but it's an arguably better primary and ultrawide camera. It's a much more powerful chip. the new better selfie cameras in there. And it also now starts at 256 gigs. It's at 120 Hz now. And so it is $100 cheaper than the equivalent Pixel. And you know, I don't even think people are necessarily crossopping these two phones, but just as far as how much phone you get for your money, they've done a much better job finally in the base iPhone. But either way, let me know what you want to see in the full reviews. I asked on Twitter which one of the phones you guys are most interested in, and iPhone Air 1. Not a shocker. That'll probably be the first review. But then the Air and the Pro. There's a lot to talk about the vapor chambers, the cooling, the camera, the new selfie cameras, and just which ones are good deals at which prices and also new pricing because there's a $2,000 two TBTE iPhone Pro Max. But leave a comment down below. I'll check those out. And be sure to get subscribed to see those reviews when they first come out. And if you are actively planning on getting a 17 series iPhone, then you probably also want some protection for it. In which case, channel sponsor Dbrand has some options like this ghost case. they sent over, which you can see side by side with Apple's clear case. Uh, no comment. I'll just let you be the judge. Also, look how good a black pro iPhone could have looked this year if they made one, but they didn't. But thankfully, Dbrand has it covered with their new tank case, which in addition to being matte black, is also totally overkill. It's this super rugged case that's obviously going to be really protective, but also just from the looks of it, probably pretty divisive. Some of you will love it, some of you will hate it. Again, I'll let you be the judge. If nothing else, though, it's definitely matte black. And of course, because it's Dbrand, they put a ton of Easter eggs all over this case and used a bunch of different textures to make it feel super grippy. And bonus, the buttons are customizable cuz you can just pop them out and swap them with colored replacements to add a little personal touch, or just leave them black, which is probably how I'd go. They've also both got super strong magnets. That's something I've noticed about Dbrand's cases is they've stepped up the Mag Safe game with their own magnet strength lately. So, I'll leave a link to the tank case and the ghost case down below if you want to check them out, whichever one you want. Thanks for watching. Catch you very soon in the next one. Peace.","Unboxing every new iPhone 17 series phone and taking a second look. Reviews incoming.

2025-09-15,AirPods Pro 3 Review: I Understand It Now!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB0b6KFZVq0,"(gentle techno music) - Okay, so this is actually the same thing that happened to me with
the last generation, where it's September, it's really busy. I didn't really think I
was gonna review these. There's lots of other
stuff I gotta get to, but just like last time, Apple sent me their latest AirPods Pros. And the first thing I
did this time with them was get on a plane and fly with them. And now, I gotta show
you these new headphones. These are AirPods Pro 3. They look physically almost
the same as AirPods Pro 2, but there's actually a
host of new things here. And the thing is I'm not
normally an earbuds person and I'm certainly not typically a wear my headphones all day,
every day type of person, like so many are. But with all the improvements
that they've stacked up in this third generation, I get it. I totally get it. And I think there are
a lot of things in here specifically made for that type of person. But first of all, they
still sound really good. This was one of the first things I was impressed with with the last gen and I even did some
back-to-back listening. And I think these sound
even a little bit better. There's more strong base and low end while still keeping, you know, a totally full mid-range
and crisp bright highs and very little high volume distortion. And they do seem to get even louder too. And there's a couple reasons
behind this sound improvement. If you look very carefully, you'll notice the vents are
actually slightly bigger and the interior is redesigned
to allow for more airflow. So, I'm betting that's where a bit of that
better bass response comes from. But then, also the ear
tips go into your ears at a slightly different angle, which you can tell if you
look at the second gen right next to this third gen. And the new ear tips are also bolstered with a little bit of foam inside the end. So, they're not fully foam ear tips. They're still silicon, but you kind of get the
best of both worlds now. The foam ear tips that
you might see on some IMs, you kind of compress them, and then let them expand in your ear. It's this really nice
seal and a great fit, but not great for everyday use outside. So, this has some of
those benefits in the tip. They have some foam
that kind of like molds to the inside of your ear. It's a little bit firmer and
it does fit a little better, so it's a better seal. And I gotta say this new
combo of the new ear tips, which there's also now a double
extra small size by the way. So, there's five ear tip sizes. But the new ear tips plus the new angle that they go into your ear
makes these the first air pods that have ever stayed in my ears. It's been years and generations of AirPods that have always slightly
wiggled out over time, but these actually stay and
that's a game changer for me. Now, I still give the
nod to the Powerbeats Pro for working out just because that piece that goes around your ear
for the extra bit of security when you're running, or jumping, or moving around a lot,
that can't be beat. But for the everyday
walking around headphones, these are incredible. They've also added IP57
dust and water resistance for the first time. So they were IPX4 before, which meant they could take a splash, or a sprinkle, or go out in the rain, but now they are protected
against a little bit of dust and they can fully survive
being submerged underwater. So, that's better for heavy rain, better for spills especially, and even better for a ton of sweat. Like if you somehow sweat
so much that AirPods couldn't handle it before,
they can now handle it. And turns out this case
is also IP57 rated as well which is nice, but that does
actually mean it's a new case. And so, the more you
look at this new case, the more you'll notice there's a bunch of other little small
differences here as well. Like it's a tiny bit thicker and taller, because of the new shape of the buds. And then also, the cutout for the pairing/battery
indicator light is now gone, but the light's still there. It's just behind the plastic now and quite a bit brighter, clean. And also just like AirPods 4, the pairing button is gone from the back. So pro tip, if you do need
to manually pair these to a non-Apple device for
some reason like a computer or an Android phone, you
have to open the case and double tap the front to
put them in pairing mode. Then there's also a next
generation Ultra Wideband chip in the case, which means
you can do precision finding from 50% further away, which
is extremely convenient. Honestly might still be
an underrated feature. The old buds don't fit in the new case and the new buds don't fit
in the old case, by the way, just in case you are wondering. And then, there's also some articles about how these don't seem
to come with a charging cable and that's true. I unbox them. Sure enough, there was no
USB type C cable in that box, but also neither do AirPods 4. And I think you know, to be honest, like most other headphones
come with the charging cable, but I think Apple is
assuming, probably fairly, that if you're buying the new AirPods, which suck to use with
any non-Apple device, then you 99.9% most likely
already have an iPhone from the past three years and therefore, already have a USB type C charger or you already have an Apple Watch, which it can also use that charger, or you already have some
MagSafe puck somewhere that you can also use. They're probably right,
but also the battery life is actually longer on these
two, so they'll do eight hours with noise cancellation up from six. So, you can ignore your coworkers for an entire uninterrupted nine to five. And then, transparency mode or hearing aid functionality
will do up to 10 hours now from the previous six. Slide in the keynote that rose my eyebrow
the most when I saw it when they introduced this a few days ago was ""World's best Active
Noise Cancellation,"" of any in-ear wireless headphones. No asterisk, no fine print, no weird comparisons or anything, just all gas, no breaks, big claim. Now, Apple says a lot of things, things like the iPhone 16 Pro has studio quality microphones. Stuff that's obviously not totally true or that's greatly exaggerated
for marketing purposes. But this one, this one's interesting. So, the way they're quantifying it is they're saying it
cancels twice as much noise as the last gen, which
were already really good. Matter of fact, if you go
and watch that 2022 keynote, when they introduced the AirPods Pro 2, they said that those
were twice as powerful as the first gen AirPods Pro. Now, these do have the same H2 chip as the previous generation,
so it's not the chip, but the new ear tips with foam, the new angle that they go into your ears, and the bigger vents and probably some more
improved software tuning all combine to give you much better, allegedly two times noise
cancellation from the previous. And yeah, the ANC is
pretty incredible in these. With my music at basically half volume, I already hear nothing but my music. Now in this studio environment, where you know, there's some voices, maybe occasional louder noises, one really loud mechanical keyboard and a few dog barks,
like that's pretty easy. I'm locked in. I'm only hearing my music. But I also took a flight
with these, like I said, and the white noise of the
airplane just dropped down. It was almost completely
erased, not totally to zero, but more than enough to fully immerse in whatever media I want to and actually enjoy the
improved audio quality, which is saying something. And these of course still
have other features, transparency mode, adaptive EQ, conversational awareness is here I'm just, I'm very happy with this ANC. I went and compared them back to back with the Bose QC Ultra 2, which I found less comfortable and don't seal in my ear as well. And they also don't cancel as much sound. The Sony WF-1000XM5 sound really good, but the fit and noise cancellation
also aren't as strong. And these Galaxy Buds 3
Pro are very comfortable and I think even look better,
but don't sound as good or cancel as much background noise. These have been pretty excellent for me. Still no lossless audio to
anything not called Vision Pro, but this is about as good as I've heard wireless earbuds sound. Now speaking of workout headphones, these also have a new feature and it's this little window
over here in the back of them, that's a heart rate monitor. So, AirPods Pro 3 can
measure your heart rate while working out. I consider this a nice to have the same way it was in the Powerbeats Pro. What's nice is it's well integrated in the Apple Fitness app. So even if other earbuds
integrate heart rate sensors, not sure they'll be able to plug in to this ecosystem as nicely
to count your calories and keep your rings closed. Classic. But it's nice for people who
don't have Apple Watches. So if you do have an Apple Watch and you wear it at the
same time and work out, apparently it's using its
own algorithms and software to decide which is the better
source to take that data from. Because at no point does the app tell you or let you choose where it's
getting your heart rate. Apple also introduced live translation alongside AirPods Pro 3. It's not exclusive to these like they might want you to think. So I won't spend too much
time on it in this review, but it is powered by Apple Intelligence and it does require you download each individual language
offline before using it. So, everything works offline
without internet connection. So, that's cool. And I'm starting to think
this is the perfect year to do a big comparison just on all
these live translate features 'cause it seems like 2025 is
the year of live translation. And there's a bunch of
different versions of it and I kind of wanna see which one's best, like is it a phone app, or
is it phone plus headphones, or will it be smart glasses
with AI, or will it be a pin? That probably won't be a pin. But this really feels like
the year live translation actually finally became possible. But overall, okay,
better fit, better sound, better ANC, IP rating
now, better battery life, all for the same price. I get it. People who wear AirPods all day are gonna love these things. People who sometimes wear AirPods are also gonna love these things. Honestly, the only reason they're not about to become my new dailies is because I still prefer
over-ear headphones. So, I mostly still use
my Sonys for traveling, and listening to music,
and watching movies. Anytime I'm on a plane, I have these. And then when I work out, it's back to dedicated workout headphones, which for me are still the Powerbeats. But if you want one pair of
headphones to do everything or if you're on the fence, like these really don't
have any weaknesses, if you're an iPhone user. Well played Apple, well played. Now fun fact, the original AirPods were announced 3,295 days ago and they still look like this, Like the tech has gotten way, way better. But all these generations
later, they still go with this small white,
glossy dental floss case. So, channel sponsor
Dbrand can change that. 'Cause the grip case for the AirPods Pro 3 is a great way to keep
that charging case safe from scuffs, and scratches, and drops. But I'm really just into
how you can change up the look of the things,
because you can customize it literally dozens of ways. I've got the matte black one here, but they've got a ton of
options to choose from and it goes perfectly with
any of Dbrand's phone cases like this Grip case, which can also be customized
to match your AirPods or even Dbrand's new Tank Case, this super overkill tactical
looking case they've launched alongside the iPhone 17 series. So if you're like me and you wish there was a matte black
iPhone 17 Pro this year, well then either of these
are pretty good options. So if you are trying to pick
up a case for your AirPods or your iPhone 17, then I highly recommend checking out Dbrand Link will be down below. Thanks for watching. Catch you very soon. It's techtember. I'll catch
you real soon in the next one. Peace. (gentle techno music)","AirPods Pro 3 got upgrades in the right places. They're so damn good (for iPhones)

2025-09-10,iPhone 17/Pro/Air Impressions: Spot the Red Flags!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idEAABFzpfg,"(upbeat music) - Hey, what's up, MKBHD here, and welcome to your
first look and hands-on of everything Apple
has just unveiled today at their 2025 September event. This is iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Air. Definitely get subscribed
to be among the first to see the full reviews
when they come out. But this is my first impressions. And I actually found it pretty simple to synthesize my thoughts on everything they announced today. Like there is some good tech, there's some interesting new designs, and some questionable decisions. But the funny thing is, you
know, as I go to these events, and as I think about all of this stuff, what usually happens is I end up typically getting some texts from friends asking what I think of the announcements. And my mental task is to summarize everything I'm thinking about into one or two easily-digestible
sentences, or just words, to understand what's
new and what happened. I don't wanna tell them
too much information. And so that's what I'm gonna give you about each of the things
Apple announced today. I'm gonna give you my super, super compressed
version of what I saw. So let's just start with
the iPhone 17, right? The base new iPhones. My ultra-simple summary for the iPhone 17 would be, hey, it got ProMotion
and a better selfie camera, and the rest is mostly the same. So the design is mostly unchanged, other than the new colors. Same screen sizes, same
dimensions, same camera bump, same buttons, and camera control, which they barely talked about. But there's a new A19 chip
inside, which we expected. That should see some
nice performance gains and efficiency bumps. Roughly 20% faster CPU, which is nice. And battery life should
be a few beats longer. And the display is brighter
too, getting up to 3,000 nits. But this is the first time we are seeing a Pro-branded
feature on a non-Pro iPhone, because every new iPhone across the range now has ProMotion. And it's the same ProMotion too. It's the adaptive 1 to 120 hertz. Doesn't seem to be handicapped at all. It's funny, we always used to have that ""Oh, regular people don't care
about 120 hertz"" argument. But now here it is on
the new base iPhones, so hey, sounds great to me. This makes the base
iPhones much more usable, and so does the new base
storage of 256 gigs. So those are welcome upgrades. But the other new thing
was the selfie camera. And it was funny, the
keynote was pretty chill, up until the point where they
started to talk about this, and it was actually the loudest applause, and it was really tempting
to make fun of it. But I actually do think
this was really clever, because all these new iPhones have this massively-upgraded
selfie camera system. They're calling it Center Stage, but I actually think that
kind of does a disservice, because the actual Center Stage
on their laptops and stuff is kind of annoying. But what's happening is with these phones, they all have a larger 24-megapixel square selfie camera sensor. And so then when you go to take a selfie, the phone can take a
regular vertical selfie, or can manually, or even automatically, take a horizontal selfie without you having to rotate the phone. And honestly, this might be genius. Like the default for most people is obviously to take
a vertical selfie now. It just fits on the phone. You're probably viewing it on the phone. But if you go to take a horizontal selfie to fit more people, suddenly the camera
lens is off to the side, and it's a little bit
less natural-looking. So now since the selfie camera
is larger, and a square, it can literally just crop
an 18-megapixel selfie in portrait or landscape. And for videos or photos. I think it's great, it's very useful. It might be the biggest
upgrade to the iPhone 17. So then there's the iPhone 17 Pro. And my quick, friendly
summary of the Pro phones is, hey, they got better
zoom, and more battery, and orange. So the Pro iPhones actually
look a little bit different. There's actually quite a bit going on here with this new design. First of all, there's only three colors. Cosmic Orange, Deep Blue, and Silver. Really bumming me out that
there's no black Pro phone. But then I remembered dbrand exists. Nevermind. But then the thing that's gonna catch
everyone's eye on the back is the camera bar up at the top, which is what Apple keeps
calling in their keynote a plateau. It kind of looks a little
bit like the Pixel's visor, or frankly, what we've been seeing on a ton of other Android
phones for years now. Just a huge bar across the
top of the back of the phone. But it's actually not
just cameras in here. Apple's done some rearranging
of the insides of the phone, to actually shove more components, like the A19 Pro chip, and
the logic board and storage up here in that bar, so they could fill out more
of the bottom of the phone with more battery. And that approach is
gonna make even more sense in a little bit. But my first reaction to
that is, oh yeah, great, that sounds like these Pro phones might actually come with a real
substantial battery upgrade from last year, which is, again, very welcome. Now you might also notice
some other little things like the millimeter-wave
antenna at the top of the phone, and the ring around that plateau actually also being an antenna. But then the other new design element is that they actually
switched back to aluminum. Which is interesting, because we just saw, like, two years ago the iPhone 15 Pro's
whole thing was titanium. The new titanium color and titanium rails. And it was a whole big deal. But now they're switching back
to aluminum in a unibody form because it's much better thermally. And so there's also a new vapor chamber right in the middle of
the back of this phone. First time we've seen a
vapor chamber on the iPhone. And so this new cooling system, and new unibody aluminum build, should mean the iPhone
shouldn't get nearly as hot from sustained loads to the chip. Which is different from normal, bursty, quick on-and-off
workloads of everyday use. I'm talking more about
like rendering long videos, or playing an intense game for a long time with ray tracing at high frame rates. This phone should be able to keep cool, and keep that performance
high without overheating. Apple is saying 40% better
sustained performance. So yeah, this design, it is just a little bit
more than meets the eye. You know, rearranging some
components here and there, being more efficient, better cooling, and better battery. The number that they quoted on stage was 39 hours of video playback, which, whatever, dumb
stat, video playback. It's kind of ridiculous. But okay, we'll take that. And I also looked up the iPhone
16 Pro Max's video playback, and that was also a
great battery life phone. That one quoted 33 hours. So maybe up to like 10%
battery life on this phone, which is sick. And then there's the
cameras that I mentioned. They always go hard with
Pro phones and cameras. And this generation is no exception, with the main improvement being the new 48-megapixel
4X telephoto camera. Now 4X might be a lesser
number than last year's 5X, but that was a smaller
12-megapixel sensor. This new zoom camera
is a 56% larger sensor, and has way more resolution. It's 48 megapixels. So that is a smaller gap between the main camera and the zoom. And you should be able to
continue to zoom further, and crop more with less consequence, now that you have 48 megapixels. The Pro phones also get
the new selfie camera, they also get the new brighter display. These also got Qi2 support. And then they also got
some seriously Pro features that I'm looking forward to testing, like Genlock sync support,
and also ProRes RAW video, which I will hopefully be getting to test in an autofocus video coming up very soon. But of course there was one
more new iPhone, the iPhone Air. No number, just Air. And you all know what that means? They're doing the ultra-thin thing, and they're leaning in hard. So this thing is a
stunningly, ridiculously thin 5.6 millimeters at the thinnest part. And you can tell from the commercials, you can tell from my footage here, and, you know, the first
time I hold the phone it has the same effect on me that the S25 Edge did from Samsung, which is just, it's so sick. Like clearly nobody's
asking for thinner phones, but once you hold one,
it is pretty impressive that they're able to
make something like this. But there are also
absolutely some red flags that come along with this. So the basics are, it's a
6.5-inch ProMotion display. It's got the A19 Pro chip inside. Titanium body. The new selfie camera
of course is in there, and it has a single 48-megapixel
Fusion camera on the back with the new design, again. Same camera as the iPhone 17, but with the nice plateau
from the Pro phone. And then there's a new N1 chip inside for all the networking connectivity, which is Wi‑Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, Thread, and a new, more energy-efficient
C1X modem for cellular. I put out a short that
basically already said this, but I really think this phone
is gonna be a hard sell, because if you subtract emotions from it, it's the worst one. This is gonna jump in the lineup at 999. It replaces essentially the
Plus phones in the lineup. And it is surrounded by other iPhones that are better than it
in basically every way, other than being super thin and light. So it's a fascinating gamble. This phone has the same A19 Pro chip in it as the Pro phones, minus one GPU core. Interesting choice. Apparently it's a bit more
efficient than the base A19, so that's good for battery life. But we also just heard a
whole long list of choices Apple made with the Pro phones to make them more thermally
efficient to not overheat. Switching from titanium to aluminum, and adding a vapor chamber to the back. But this phone is still titanium, and absolutely does not have room for an advanced thermal solution, or any sort of vapor chamber. So it sounds like this
phone could get much hotter, and throttle performance much quicker. It's a red flag. Now we also know that ultra-thin phones have a tendency to be a
little bit less durable. They've bent over the years. And I'm not gonna be the
first one to point this out. I mean, you're, I'm sure already glued to
JerryRigEverything's channel for his bend test. And Apple of course
has thought about this. They've for sure tested this, and they're telling us it's
the most durable iPhone ever. But I mean, I'm looking at the phone, and I think it qualifies
also as a red flag. And then we already know
there is just no way battery life can be good
on this phone, right? There's just no way. I've been reviewing phones
for more than a decade, and all signs point to it being trash. There was a slide in the keynote today about how they were still proud to achieve all-day battery life. But, like come on. Really? I mean they still do the thing where they rearranged the components up into the little plateau at the top to make room for more
battery at the bottom. But there's just absolutely
not enough room in this phone for a large battery. And it doesn't appear
to be silicon-carbon, or any sort of a special
ultra-high density battery. And Apple also announced it alongside a special dedicated
MagSafe battery accessory, just for this phone, that adds 3,149 mAh, and just barely, combined,
will match the 17 Pro in terms of quoted video playback. So if that doesn't scream red flag, I don't know what to tell you. It is also e-SIM-only, globally, 'cause there's no room in
any version of this phone for a plastic SIM card. There's also no millimeter-wave 5G. And like I said, it's coming in at $1,000, which is more expensive
than the base iPhone, which will have a better camera system, and better battery life, and may overheat less. So look, I think there's two
ways to look at this phone. This is either Apple just
throwing something new at the wall and seeing if it sticks. Like we just saw them try, okay, they had the Mini
phone for, like, two years, and that really didn't sell that well. So then they moved to the Plus, and that was also a
little bit underwhelming. So now they're trying that
same spot in the lineup for a ultra-thin phone, and seeing if maybe they can market that to turn into some more sales. So you can see it as that. Or you can see this as a visionary, long-time-in-the-making preview at the future of all phones. Like, maybe someday in the future every phone will be this thin. And Apple is just now, today,
getting the tech together with the battery and display and modem and Apple Silicon to
make this phone possible. Maybe kind of like how the
first MacBook Air sucked, and was underpowered, but then eventually all
laptops became that thin. Maybe that's also what's
gonna happen to smartphones. And maybe the same way Samsung
made the ultra-thin S25 Edge, and then a few months later they came out with their super-thin
foldable, the Z Fold7, and I felt like the Edge phone was one half of that foldable. Maybe that's also what Apple's doing. Maybe we're gonna see an ultra-thin foldable iPhone next year. Maybe. Either way, I do think it's clear that you probably won't find
too many logical reasons to pick up this first-gen iPhone Air. But I do also think that
picking it up and holding it is gonna convince a lot of people, 'cause it's pretty stunning in person. And it's the same thing I
said about the Samsung phone. It's pretty sick. But only time will tell
for that part of the story. Now, there were a couple
other announcements today. There were new AirPods Pro 3, which have twice as good
ANC as the last gen, which is crazy. Plus IP57, and heart rate
tracking during workouts. All at the same $250 price. Definitely gonna test those. And there's also a new Apple
Watch Series 11, now with 5G, and possible hypertension detection. And a slightly new Watch Ultra 3 with thinner bezels, LTPO3, and slightly longer battery life. I'm gonna be testing all this stuff over the next couple weeks, so get subscribed and I'll
see you in those videos. And shout out to channel sponsor Ridge for being ahead of the game, because while the iPhone
Air does lack battery, it does still have MagSafe, which means you're gonna wanna
pick up a Ridge Power Bank. I've seen plenty of power banks over my 15 years of reviewing tech, but this Ridge one
quickly became a favorite. It's got five ways to charge, 15-watt MagSafe-compatible
wireless charging, two built-in cables, USB-C up to 20 watts, and Lightning for older Apple devices. And a charging pad for your Apple Watch, pass-through charging,
so it doubles as a hub, and it also comes in three colors. Matte Black, Matte Olive, and, I guess, perfect for
the new iPhone 17 Pro color, Basecamp Orange. Ridge also makes a MagSafe card holder that snaps right onto your iPhone and holds up to three cards. Every Ridge product comes
with a lifetime warranty, and a 99-day risk-free trial. So get one today, and head over to
ridge.com/mkbhd for 10% off. Thanks for watching. See you guys very soon in the next videos. Peace. (upbeat music)","Everything new from Apple's 2025 September event

2025-08-29,Pixel 10/Pro Review: Good News and Bad News!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i63u-iAnhuk,"(relaxing dance music) - All right, I have
good news and bad news. What do you want first? The good news, great. Good call. It's still a Pixel. The bad news? It is still a Pixel. (lively dance music) See, the Pixel 10 has had some high hopes and some hype behind it
for the past couple months. You know, it's the 10th generation. It could be special. The first one with a TSMC
chip could be special. Some other things could be
revamped alongside Android 16. Like, it was looking really promising to potentially reboot
the whole Pixel thing, to finally have it really
competing with flagships. Now instead, it is very
much all the things we liked and all the things we disliked
about the Pixel already, but the competing with flagships part is coming in the form of a
mainstream marketing push. A Jimmy Fallon presentation,
a Jonas Brothers music video. I can't say I would've spent
the money the exact same way if I was in charge of the Pixel program, but hey, that's why I'm the reviewer and they're the Google executives. So, unlike the event, let's
just focus on the phones. So, this thing is very similar
to last year in design, in materials, and in character. Like the camera visor,
the glossy glass back with the satin aluminum sides, and vice versa on the Pro phones. Even as an enthusiast about this stuff, you could probably show me a Pixel 9, and unless I knew exactly which
one was the new gray color, it could be easily
mistaken for the new one. And to me, honestly, that's fine. I love this design. The camera bar is nice
for holding the phone. It gathers some dust, sure, but you'll probably also
have a case on your phone. Great, click-y buttons, great haptics. All of these things are
still true about the Pixel. The bad news though, is that
the things that the Pixels of the past have been lacking,
this one is still lacking. Pixels have never had the biggest numbers or the most bleeding-edge hardware. And these Pixel 10s are still Pixels, so they don't have super fast charging. They don't have a brand new
massive silicon carbon battery. They don't have huge new camera sensors or record-breaking displays. My personal biggest
annoyance with the Pixel 9 was the optical under
screen fingerprint reader was kinda slow. This Pixel 10 actually does have an ultrasonic fingerprint reader now, and it's faster than Pixel 9, but just a slight beat behind the other ultrasonic flagships now. But that counts as technically new. So, hey, while we're at
it, here's everything that's technically new with the Pixel 10s and my take on them. The main new thing is we
get a full triple cameras on the base phone, and I'll
get more into the quality of those cameras in a minute,
so that is a nice inclusion. After that, it's a bunch
of subtle things that sort of combine to make it feel
a little more flagship-y but without actually leapfrogging into ultra phone territory. So, the fingerprint reader, like I said, is ultrasonic now and slightly faster. And the display that it's built into is a bit brighter too, so
it looks better outdoors. The bezels didn't get thinner, but there's little grills now over the slightly better speakers
at the bottom of the phone that are color matched to the metal now. Cool. And the physical SIM card
tray is now completely gone. This phone in the US is eSIM
only, which I don't like. eSIM support, great. Forcing me to use eSIM? Not my favorite thing. Only the carriers win with this. And to be fair, maybe
I'm over-indexing this just a little bit because
I test a lot of phones. I move my physical SIM card really quickly between lots of phones. It takes, like, 10 seconds to switch and test something out real quick. So, I don't like this at
all, but yeah, eSIM only. The batteries are about
200 milliamp hours larger in these phones across the lineup. That's a nice win. But the internals that are
gonna make a real difference that people are actually gonna care about are Tensor and Pixel Snap. So, all right, we gotta talk
about this new Tensor chip. Google phones, for years, have used off-the-shelf
chips from Qualcomm, which made sense, they were great. And then the Pixel 6 was the first one to use their in-house
design Tensor chip instead. And the promise of Tensor
was never really clear, but the idea was to give
Google much more control over these chips and for optimizing for exactly what they
wanna get out of a Pixel. The thing is, the first
Tensor chip wasn't that good. Actually, it was so weak that
it had people considering if they should have even left
Qualcomm in the first place. But, you know, we gotta let 'em cook for a little bit, right? Let them develop this idea. And so, a couple generations in, all of these first few Tensor chips were sort of co-designed
with Google and Samsung, and it was heavily based
off of an Exynos chip and actually still fabricated by Samsung. So, fast forward to today, the Pixel 10 is powered
by a Tensor G5 chip, the first version of a totally
Google-designed Tensor chip on a three-nanometer process and manufactured straight by TSMC, which seems like the perfect opportunity to make a huge leap in
power, in efficiency, in achieving the original mission of doing their own Tensor chip, and it turns out it's good. It's a really good chip,
but it's not magic. The main complaint that I and
other Redditors would have about Tensor chips of the past was that they were simply
not flagship level power of CPU and GPU. And this is $1,000 phone. Like, for this price, I
could just get a Galaxy S25+ and have a Snapdragon 8 Elite, or an iPhone 16 with an A18. So, this new Tensor G5 is
more performant than before, but it's not miraculously
jumping all the way to the level of the Snapdragon 8 Elites of the world. And I'm starting to think that's not even really one of its goals. Tensor G5 benchmarks
like a mid-range phone, like the CPU is about 30%
better than last generation, but is a solid amount still behind the Snapdragon
chips in Samsung phones. And it's closer to, like, the 8S Gen 4, the one in the Nothing Phone 3. And the GPU. The GPU gap, if my benchmarks are correct, are even bigger. For some reason, Geekbench 6 OpenCL scores are literally half of the Pixel 9s and a full, like, 600% behind
the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Jesus. Its strongest area though,
is definitely the TPU, where this one is 60% more
powerful than last generation, and that is intentional. This is the Tensor processing unit that's specifically designed
to accelerate machine learning and AI-related tasks like
running on device models, editing photos, et cetera. This is what Google has decided
is most important to them with these phones and these chips. They want them to be the fastest and most capable AI devices. So, in the real world,
performance wise, this Pixel 10, it is a really smooth
phone with everyday tasks. I've been flying around Android 16, multitasking, flying through apps, high refresh rate is always on. Not even really thinking
about it too much. It's been very fluid. I will say though, when I went in after a few
days into display settings and flipped from High
resolution to Max resolution, things sharpened up a bit, but the phone also did get slightly, just barely noticeably, slower. Just a few dropped frames here and there, which I didn't expect. And I would also not be shocked at all if you did head-to-head comparisons with graphically intense games, and frame rate measurements
of the Pixel 10 fall far behind the higher,
more powerful GPU chips. It also lacks
hardware-accelerated ray tracing. That's just not the big
strength of this phone. Never has been. And it's still a Pixel, so I'm not expecting it ever will be. What I can say is, at least the battery life
for my use has been solid. It's been solid. I've been mostly testing the Pixel 10 Pro, not the XL, so even on
a regular-sized phone, I'm getting all-day battery
near dead by the end of the day, but, like, six hours of screen-on time and high brightness and all that. So, it's been decently efficient. My main concern is now shifting to how well this phone will age, so maybe trying to come
back to this in six months, one year, two years, just
to see how well this does compared to previous Pixels. But for now, the Tensor chip, it's not some miraculous savior that makes it an ultra
flagship, but good chip. Good chip. You know what's really good, though? Pixel Snap. It sounds silly, but this
has genuinely become one of my favorite new features
about the Pixel 10s. It's just such a quality
of life improvement, especially as someone who
is a card-carrying member of Team No Case. So, these phones have Qi2
wireless charging now, and it's only at 15
watts, or 25 on the XL, but it's so incredibly convenient to just be able to slap the Pixel onto any of my existing MagSafe accessories, navigating with the phone
in the dash in the morning, dropping the phone on a
wireless charger on my desk where they automatically align, keeping it topped up on a long travel trip with my Ridge power bank. Even if you aren't someone with a bunch of existing MagSafe stuff sitting around, it just opens you up to this massive world of options for magnetic accessories for things you can attach to your phone, or things you can attach your phone too. And I even think this is
actually slightly stronger than MagSafe magnets on the iPhone, at least with the first-party
Google accessories they've optimized, like
with this Pixel ring stand I got to try. Honestly, this was the perfect
addition to this phone. It's like it was already a phone that didn't have very
fast wireless charging, and so it still doesn't have
very fast wireless charging, but it just gained a ton of functionality. Thumbs up. The two things that always
make a Pixel a Pixel though, well, that would be the
cameras and the software. So, I have good news and bad news again. Which do you want first? The good news. Classic. Yeah, the software is still awesome. These phones all ship with
Android 16 out the box, all of the fun material,
3 Expressive updates, the fun smart wallpaper cutout
effects, the animations, the haptics, the
notification jiggle physics, all this stuff. There's some weird stuff
that's not all perfect, like I don't love how massive some of the buttons are getting. Like, okay, maybe the
Alarm app one makes sense. Fine, make those bigger. But the Weather app, like this list of locations
has such massive gaps now. So much dead white space between them. Or the Phone app now, too. They're making these buttons huge. This new Gmail app, these archive buttons
are absolutely massive. And look at this stopwatch. Jesus. But, you know, for the most part, I'm loving how colorful and clean and fluid everything has been. And there's so many little
things you can tweak and poke around and have fun with. Trust me, just watch a
few YouTube tutorials on how to set up the
perfect quick settings or have the ultimate
all-widgets home screen set up. It's awesome, super flexible. You're welcome. And then there's all the
AI stuff on top as well because, you know, Google. And there's a lot of this
stuff that sort of just pops up as you start using this phone, and you can choose to engage with it or just kind of ignore
it if you're not into it. But any one of these
features could turn out to be that awesome thing that
makes you wanna stick with the Pixel, like Call
Screening or Now Playing. And so, the big new one on the Pixel 10s that's got its own section in the settings and everything is called Magic Cue. And this Magic Cue,
it's a very Google thing that's supposed to take data
from across your different apps and services and then surface
them where you need them. At least that's what it's supposed to do. Now, I was using this phone
and trying to get it to work. Like I was lobbing up perfect
situations for it to kick in and read my Gmail or read my calendar, and then give me the
perfect text to send back, but it rarely seemed to work
exactly the way I wanted it to like it did in my original demos. The thing it did the most often was it just kept giving me a link back to, like, open my calendar and check for the information myself, which is still kinda helpful, but only half as helpful as advertised. I have all the settings turned on, so it's supposed to be able to
look into any of these apps, screenshots, email, Messages,
also Keep and Contacts and Calendar to return the answer to the question pulled
from inside the app. A few times, I did actually
get that to work for me, but sometimes it was wrong. Like I have Andrew asking me
for my flight info next week, but it's giving me the info to
the flight I have this week, and that would be fine
if I could go edit it before I send it, but if I click it it, just sends the whole thing automatically, and doesn't also include
some of the information I would think you want,
like the flight number. I can see the promise here. It feels like it's still
a work in progress. The other thing, though, that
I found pretty interesting was conversational editing. It actually is coming to all
phones with Google Photos, so it's not just, like,
a specific Pixel thing, so I won't spend too much time on it, but it's potentially a game changer because it's semantic photo
editing from text prompts, so it understands what you're asking for and then does the editing for you, from simple stuff like, you know, brighten up the faces
or remove the road sign, or even just make this picture better, which usually does, like, a nice crop and centers it around the subject and evens out the exposure. But all the way up to
complicated stuff too, like, ""Add a hot air balloon to the sky."" It'll do that. Or, ""Delete the cars
and make the sky bluer."" And then it does it. It just does a surprisingly good job just from hearing what you said. Google, genuine question, is video editing next? Is that even possible? Should I be concerned? Excited? I don't know, we'll see. There was a couple other things like the Journal app and NotebookLM, which are both pre-installed
on these phones. Also, daily briefs was
next to useless for me. Like it's supposed to be tailored to me and relevant to my day, but yeah, that's not really a ton of
useful information here. But overall, like I said,
the software is really good. And if there's anything that
pops up that you don't like, you can literally just ignore it. So, that is the good news. So then the bad news, the cameras. And this is where it kinda
gets a little bit weird. It's not like they're bad cameras, but the bad news is that it
does feel like the cameras are slipping a little bit. The Pixel has leaned heavily on elite software processing for years. They, surprise, never really
had the biggest sensors or the best hardware,
but they pioneered HDR+, and the Pixel camera always had this sort of confident, contrasty look to it. This generation of phones,
it still has that look, but objectively speaking,
like these cameras, they just don't stand out from the pack nearly as much anymore. And in some ways, they're kind
of falling behind a bit now. Triple cameras, like I said, are awesome to have on the base phone. So, that 48 megapixel main camera, the ultrawide, and the telephoto is a 5x. And then the Pros have a bigger
50 megapixel main camera, a bigger, higher resolution ultrawide, and a bigger, higher resolution
5x telephoto as well. So, regular wide shots from
the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro, they look great. You know, sure, the
sensor's a little smaller on the base phone, but
they both do a great job with sharpness and dynamic
range and lots of detail, and usually pretty great color too. They have that look. Night Sight is still elite. But past that, it's just
not good at any type of zoom like I was hoping it would be. The ultrawide is okay, but usually pretty soft around the edges with a bit more chromatic aberration that I'm used to seeing. And then trying to zoom in was,
like, just surprisingly bad, at least compared to other
flagships with decent zoom. Almost every photo I've taken, even on these Pros that's
zoomed in, is just soft. Like, colors would be fine
and it's bright enough, and it's not a terrible image. Mission still accomplished, I guess. But, like, this super res
zoom feature on the Pros that kicks in for everything past 30x really feels like it encourages me to take a bunch of Zoom
photos because once I do, it'll run it through the
processing and sharpen things up and resolve detail out of thin air with a little machine learning. But yeah, the results
just weren't that great. I didn't even go all the way to a 100x. All the pictures I'm taking
are, like, 30 to 50x. And they kinda look like they have a cartoon filter over them, even compared to a pretty mediocre zoom like the iPhone 16 Pro. And it gets absolutely smoked by a good zoom like the S25 Ultra, even though that's more expensive. Maybe I shouldn't be complaining
about 50x zoom photos, maybe nobody cares, but the sweet spot for zoom
is definitely like 5 to 10x, or a little past that maybe. And then the wide photos are
still obviously really good. It's just the gaps in zoom
performance are a little weird, considering how much it
seems to encourage me to take zoom photos. And then there's video performance, which is still also beat
behind the flagships. If you wanna see samples, I'm planning on shooting
the next auto-focus video on the Lucid Gravity on this phone. So, if you care about
either Pixel 10 Pro video or the newest, very impressive Lucid SUV, get subscribed over there. I'll drop a link below the like button. But yeah, it'll be all the A-roll shots, and then the B roll will still be from the iPhone so you
can compare the two. So, the Pixel 10. It's still a Pixel, it feels like the Pixel is a finished slash complete thought for now, just based on the way Google's acting and working around this phone. And they're not making any
big philosophical changes to the way they attack
making a Google phone. They're just trying again
to take it to the masses. So, if you didn't like the Pixel last year for certain reasons, like, you know, ""Oh, it's not the best hardware or it's not the most powerful,"" then you still won't like the Pixel. But if you love the Pixel
of previous years 'cause, oh, it's this cool design that you like or it's got great stills
or awesome software, then you'll love this Pixel too. Google's path of trying to bring the Pixel to the masses is definitely challenging. Maybe they really believe in Jimmy Fallon and the other celebrity endorsements that will be their savior
and finally make it happen. Me personally, I think the
other half of their strategy of, like, directly addressing the masses that are on iPhones here and
giving 'em reasons to switch with, like, Pixel Snap and other directly
competitive parallel features, I think that is far more interesting. And I did just make an
entire video about this, so I'll link this below if
you haven't seen that yet. But the Pixel still being a Pixel to me is mostly good news. I really like the Pixel. I'm probably gonna switch to
this Moonstone Pixel 10 Pro as my main daily driver phone and then I'm probably gonna
switch off of it to something with more tempting,
interesting hardware features. And then I'll probably
switch back when I get bored with the other weird software experiences and I want this feeling again. And then I'll probably
switch off of it again when it starts aging poorly. I don't really know. The Pixel is right where it's always been. But you know it's not
where it's always been? New products from channel sponsor Ridge, like the new magnetic power
bank that works with Pixel Snap. See, Ridge has been in the
everyday carry scene for years. But when I joined the team, we wanted to add a little
more tech to their lineup, so they created the Ridge
Magnetic Power Bank. It's a 10,000 milliamp
hour portable battery bank that has five different
ways to charge your tech. With Pixel Snap, you can
seamlessly connect it to your back of your phone
and charge wirelessly. Or if you want, you can
use the built-in wires for 20-watt wired charging
to top up a little faster. And it even has a nice kickstand so you'll be able to
tackle any long plane ride without having to sweat your battery life. And you might be wondering, ""Why do I need a Lightning
cable if I'm a Pixel user?"" And let's be real, you
probably have some i friends, they're probably all caught
up in their blue bubble world, forgot to pack their chargers. So, if you're feeling nice,
you can help them top up too. And my favorite part is you
can charge multiple devices at the same time with pass through, so this ends up being a
nice little one-stop shop for travel charging. It comes in three sweet colors, Basecamp Orange and also Matte Olive and the obvious choice, Matte Black. And if you don't love it within 99 days, send it back, no questions asked. So, hit over to ridge.com/mkbhd

you spend until September 15th is more entries in the

17:14 The Good News"
2025-08-25,Switching from iPhone to Android,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCR17sBh-Qw,"[Music] Hey, did you see the new Google event? The Pixel 10 Pros. They look pretty good, right? Yeah, I was watching that. Look pretty sweet. Nice design, nice cameras, bunch of really interesting AI features. I'm a fan. So, you uh finally going to get one? >> Yeah, probably not. But you were just saying how good they are. Yeah, but I just I'm so used to the iPhone. I just don't want to switch. Like I I'm used to what I got and I'll I'll be fine, you know? Okay. I feel like you do this every time. What's it going to take for you to actually switch? I I I just don't want to switch. Like I I get that the phones are great and I can appreciate them. I just I'm just used to this, I guess. All right. Name one reason why you couldn't switch to the Pixel right now. Okay. Uh Face ID. It's really convenient. The Pixel has face unlock. Okay. Uh well, I just I can't get rid of my uh my wireless earbuds. You mean like Pixel Buds? Uh Mag Safe. They just added that to Pixel 10s. Uh widgets. Did I mention widgets? Okay. You're not going to believe this. Oh, right. Uh Apple Intelligence. Okay. See, now I think you're joking. Uh I just I love the number 48 and so I just need to have a 48 megapixel main camera. That's the main thing cuz see I feel like you're sort of reaching but um these also have 48 megapixel cameras so I just don't feel like it it's valid. Two years ago in the US, there was a survey that found that only 35% of people would be willing to switch their phone carrier to get a better deal. Which might not sound that crazy, but then you think about it, that means that 65% of people, even if it meant they'd spent less money, still wouldn't switch phone carriers. So that is an example of an industry with a tremendously high perceived switching cost. like switching carriers most people believe is too much of a hassle, too much time and effort to actually go through with it even if it would save them a bit of money. And so that allows carriers to get away with a little bit more because people are just not willing to switch. So anyway, the reason I bring up switching cost is I was watching this Google event this week, this spectacle of an event, and you know, besides it being a little cringey and clearly not designed to speak to me at all, I do think it was really interesting how much they directly addressed switching. So, okay, this was an event featuring Jimmy Fallon and the Jonas Brothers and a bunch of other celebrity guests like Pelaton instructors and pro athletes. So they were talking to the massive general audience that is normies in the US. And what do normies in the US use? iPhones. So this is a theme that came up several times during the event. sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly, but it all drew attention to the fact that these smartphone companies are trying to make it as easy as possible to switch to them and make it as hard as possible to switch away from them. Take the new Pixel Journal app for example. Google just announced the Pixel 10s and one of the new pre-installed apps on these phones is an AI assisted journaling app. To a lot of people, this looks like a basic copycat of that iPhone journal app that they just announced two years ago. And I wouldn't blame you for thinking that. But the other real motivation behind making an app like this is switching costs. See, Apple's going to make a journal app. And they're hoping it's good enough that people start to use it, and a lot of people really like it. And some fraction of people love it so much that they would actually refuse to use a different phone. they would refuse to switch from an iPhone if they couldn't get that anywhere else. So when Google comes along and makes their journaling app for the Pixel, they are very directly offering an equivalent experience on the other side of the fence. So now someone who really likes journaling no longer has a reason why they couldn't switch. It turns out a very direct response to your competitor adding a feature or something that potentially creates some extra lockin is to just do the same thing on your side of the fence in your own system. And the more of this event that you watch with this in mind, the more of it you very clearly see. Like you can think of Pixel Snap the same way, which is them adding these G2 wireless chargers and magnets into the back of all their Pixel 10 phones. And I always thought that this would be in more phones. Like I always was shocked that there weren't more phones with G2, especially because when you listen to iPhone people talk about MagSafe, they love it. Like people almost refuse to buy phones that don't have MagSafe now. See the comments of the iPhone 16 review. But there are some small limitations of the official CH2 support. The big one really was that it doesn't support the fastest charging speeds. So it's 15 to 25 watts with the latest edition. Not disastrously slow, but it does make sense why some of the other manufacturers like OPPO or OnePlus or Huawei wouldn't adopt it. They'd rather continue developing and leaning on their SuperV and Dash charging, which is super fast. It's one of their selling points with like 80 100 watt wireless charging. Great. Here with the Pixel though, it actually makes perfect sense because they've never had the biggest numbers or the fastest charging speeds. The Pixel 9 only charged, I think, 12 watts on a chi charger. So 15 to 25 is a big upgrade actually for wireless charging speeds. And now you get these magnets. You essentially added MagSafe to your phones with no downside. And yes, they have done more work with the array and the strength of the magnets and making their own accessories that attach really firmly to the back of the phone. So all that extra work is sick. But if you zoom out enough, Mags Safe was a reason people would resist switching from an iPhone to a Pixel. And now it's not. So so many of the times that it looks like these companies are just copying each other. Yeah, you got to keep in mind that minimizing switching costs is a huge motivator to a lot of this stuff. They used to be in a battle for new customers, but there's just so much less of that now. Like most of the world already has a smartphone. So the real battle now is actually two things. It's kids and people getting their first smartphone because once you get your first smartphone, you're likely to stick with that for a long time. and then switchers. Now, the last thing is you can't talk about switching cost in the US and normies in the US without talking about the biggest obstacle that Apple has set up, which is iMessage lockin. I've talked about this before and like every time I bring it up, a lot of you guys who are not in the US are like, ""This seems like the dumbest thing ever because that pressure does not exist outside of this place."" But here, blue bubble pressure is so real. But Google did specifically try to talk about this in their event, too. and this is how they decided to tackle it. >> So, we realized the idea of switching your phone brand can seem scary. It can even maybe be a little bit daunting. And so, we've talked about and have tackled the top two concerns that people have when it comes to switching. >> So, we can stop talking about the green text versus the blue text or the >> Yes. And first of all, I'm going to say personally the green blue bubble battle is silly and it's tired and at Google we're done with that conversation. >> Yeah. >> Uh yeah, I wasn't there so I can't confirm this but Andrew Edwards did say that they were showing applause signs to the audience who were there in person. Hm. Look, obviously if it was up to Apple, they never would have adopted RCS and they would love to keep their features as exclusive as possible in their little bubble. And then if you want to switch, you're leaving all these features behind. But now that Google's poking holes in that with interoperability and RCS, it's a little bit less of a bubble. I did make an entire video on blue bubbles versus green bubbles and that whole dynamic. So, if you want to watch that, I'll link it right here or down below the like button. But don't think Apple's never tried this stuff either. Apple would love to entice Android users to come to their side of the fence. From the move to iOS app that they built and put in the Play Store to the ad campaigns that they've run over the years, the newest Apple Intelligence feature that looks and acts a lot like that hit Circle to search feature on Android. All this stuff runs both ways. It's all in the name of competition. Something to think about. Anyway, stay tuned for the full Pixel 10 series phone reviews. And also, the iPhones are right around the corner. It's about to be TechTember. There's a lot of interesting stuff in the pipeline. Thanks for watching. Thanks for subscribing. Catch you very soon in the next one. Peace. [Music]","That terrible Google event and the battle of switching cost...

2025-08-20,Google Pixel 10/Pro/Fold Impressions: Magnets!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=269OsrzG3Ew,"(groovy upbeat music)
(logo springing) - All right, they're finally here, the new big 10th-generation
Google Pixel phones, and I've got your first hands-on
impressions of all of them. First off the plane, by the way. I'm recording this after,
like, 20 hours or so of travel back from Chengdu, China, where we just won gold with Team USA in Ultimate Frisbee at the World Games. The games were incredible. The team was incredible. And so, if for the next couple of months I use this massive gold medal
shaped like a panda as a prop, sorry in advance, I can't help it. So there were big hopes and expectations for this
whole series of phones: Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. They've been showing us the design on social media for weeks
now, but it's what's inside that has the potential
to be a game-changer. I will say, though, I actually do like the Pixel 10s' designs. At this point, the camera
bar is pretty iconic, so they're keeping that. But then this build is
even more flagship-y and high-quality than ever before. It's still IP68-rated, but now
it's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it's in these four colors: Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Lemongrass. It has a nicely upgraded top speaker. It has a brighter 3,000-nit display. They've matched, actually,
the speaker grills with the metal color. But then the two biggest things, which both technically
count as inside the phone: triple cameras and Pixelsnap. So, triple cameras. I wasn't actually sure if
they were gonna do this because we saw the leaks, and I wasn't sure if
it was the Pro or not. But it turns out they are finally doing triple cameras in the base Pixel. So we have here a
48-megapixel primary camera, a 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 10-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. So that's great, and we'll get to the
Pro cameras in a minute. But these phones all also
have what's called Pixelsnap, which is basically Google's branding word for finally including Qi2
wireless charging with magnets built into the phone. Wow! I actually didn't see that coming, but I'm very excited about it. This is one of literally two phones now that I've ever held in my hands that has the full Qi2
built into the phone, the other one being
literally the HMD Skyline that very few people have ever heard of. But I'm so happy to see it here because it means you can
wirelessly charge the phone at 15 watts. And there's also now
this whole new ecosystem of magnetic accessories that can slap onto the back of the phone, wireless chargers and stands of course, but even non-chargers like this Pixel Ring stand they're making. And it is, like, firm to
the back of the phone, which is awesome. And yes, iPhone MagSafe accessories do line up with these Qi2 magnets. So basically, any accessory out there that will lock onto the back of an iPhone will also lock onto the
back of this phone too. So Google is, of course, gonna be selling this $40 Pixelsnap charger. It's just a metal puck; you
already know how that works. And the Pixelsnap Ring is $30, and it is actually pretty
sturdy for holding up the phone at a bunch of different
angles or being a PopSocket. So, for all intents and purposes, Pixelsnap is basically MagSafe. It's great. We'll take it. So you might be thinking, ""Marques, if the base Pixel is so good and it's got the triple cameras now and it's got Pixelsnap
and all these upgrades, then what's new with the Pros? Like, is there anything
better about the Pros?"" And this has been a theme with the Pixel, which is that there isn't
that big of a difference between the base Pixel and the Pro Pixel to justify the price. And that's kind of true again here. So let's play spot the differences. So both these phones are the same size: 6.3 inches on the base,
6.3 inches on the Pro. But the Pro's display is
slightly higher resolution and slightly brighter, and it's LTPO with a full
1-to-120Hz variable refresh rate instead of 60-to-120 on the base. You also get more RAM and max storage, and it actually has a
slightly smaller battery, likely to make room for the
slightly larger triple cameras. So, same focal lengths, but now this time: 50-megapixel main camera,
48-megapixel ultra-wide, and a 48-megapixel 5x telephoto. So with the extra resolution
on that telephoto on the Pro, you can zoom in further, all the way into 100x,
it'll let you do now. And Pro Res Zoom will
do its best to use AI and try to process and sharpen what it thinks you're taking a picture of, where you can only go
into 20x with non-Pros. And the Pros come in
Moonstone, Jade, and Porcelain. Now, how much better are the
Pro's triple cameras gonna be than the base phone's triple cameras? We'll see, you know? And also, does the extra
RAM make a big difference? Is the better selfie camera
gonna make a big difference? These are things that I have
to test in my full review. So definitely get subscribed to be among the first to
see that when that drops. But at this point, doesn't seem like there's
a massive difference between the base Pixel
10 and the Pixel 10 Pro. Now the 10 Pro XL is a
little bit more interesting because then you're also getting a bigger display, of course. Also, a bigger battery,
5,200 milliamp-hours, double the starting storage as well. And it actually charges
a bit faster as well, a little more thermal room, so
up to 45 watts instead of 30. And they gave it Qi2.2, so it will wirelessly charge
at 25 watts instead of 15. But that's basically it. So the Pixel 10, Pixel 10
Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL, and they are the same
prices, all three of them, as last year. So 799, 999, and 1,199. And then there's the foldy one. So we have the Pixel 10
Pro Fold, which is exciting because we get to see now
what are some of the lessons that Google has learned along the way. They've made a first-generation foldable. Okay, so now what are
they going to improve? What are they gonna settle
in on as the real key things that they keep and the things
that they change and evolve? And this one is again for sure more flagship-y than last year, but not in a way that's gonna
blow anyone out of the water, just a definite solid
all-around improvement. The most important piece,
which is the hinge, got the most work. It's this new gearless hinge,
and because it's much smaller, it makes that left-side
bezel much more trim, leaving the outside screen feeling much more just like
a regular, normal phone instead of being slightly
offset like last year. So now it's a great phone to use closed. It's a slightly bigger
6.4-inch outer display, the same 20-by-9 aspect ratio. It's a 60-to-120Hz refresh rate, and it's up to 3,000 nits
peak brightness again. So this for sure feels like
a great closed foldable. And it's now IP68 dust-
and water-resistant, which I believe is the first
time we've ever seen a foldable be fully dust- and water-resistant. So shoutout to the hinge engineers, the hinge-gineers, for
pulling through on that one. So then I unfold it, and
it's again a large squareish eight-inch interior display. Nothing too dramatically different here. There's still a somewhat
noticeable crease; it's not terrible through
the middle, but it's there. The battery is a little bit bigger now: 5,000 milliamp-hours. That's nice to see. And yes, it also still has Pixelsnap, so Qi2 15-watt wireless
charging with the magnet array. Love that. Tensor G5. 16 gigs of RAM. Up to a terabyte of storage. And roughly the same triple
cameras as last year. It's a 48-megapixel primary
sensor; that one's new, but then the same
10-megapixel 5x telephoto and 10-megapixel ultra-wide with macro. It's all in a package
that's just slightly thicker than last year's. And the price is also the same: 1,799. And it comes in some nice,
boring Jade and Moonstone colors. So it's interesting. I like it. But I do also have to admit it doesn't really do anything
that other foldables don't. Like, it's not offering some
massive, dramatic improvement. The hardware is not incredibly thin or some crazy lack of a
crease or anything like that. It doesn't have super-fast charging. It doesn't have incredible cameras. It doesn't really do
anything super special. I mean, IP68 is pretty
new, and Pixelsnap is nice. But really, it's a Pixel. And that's the thing that matters. Like, the slightly more
flagship-y hardware is one thing that Google's been slowly getting better at over the years. But massive numbers on paper
has never been their thing. They've never had a 100-megapixel camera or 100-watt charging. But instead, the Pixel
continues the tradition of being the ""smartest"" phone in the room by just having a ton of really
useful software features. And they've added some stuff this year that strikes me as stuff that
only Google could pull off, because it's using just
so much Google stuff. Like, the two that really
stuck out to me are Magic Cues and Conversational Editing. So Magic Cues very cleverly
basically takes cues from across different services
in your Google account to surface information
where you might need it. So example, you're texting someone, and they ask you where
the dinner reservation in New York is. When Google Messages detects that, it surfaces this little rainbow cue with the answer to the
question pulled from Gmail, since you got an email
with the information in it to answer that question when you booked. So you can just tap it and have it send the
answer in Google Messages. Very convenient. Or say your friend asks you to call United to change your flight 'cause they can't do it
themselves for some reason. Okay, well, it knows
United's phone number. So it surfaces that for you. And then when you call, it
shows this nice Magic Cue with your flight information
that you're going to change, the confirmation number, and everything, so you can talk about it. That is incredibly convenient. This is the type of
thing Google can pull off because they know so much about you. They know all of your emails; they know when all of your
flights and dinner reservations and calendar events
and everything all are. This isn't new; this is
just them surfacing it in little convenient
ways to be useful to you. But then the other thing,
conversational editing, this was pretty crazy. I knew we were gonna get here eventually. I just didn't know when or
who would get there first. But the idea is, you
don't really have to know how to use the photo
editing tools on your phone. You can just talk to your
phone and tell it what to do. So like, let's say you
have this nice picture of your parents, and oh, man, it would just
be the perfect picture if he wasn't holding
that plastic bag, right? So okay, type into that box at the bottom, or just say, or literally ask
to delete the plastic bag. Then give it a few seconds,
since it's going to the cloud and back with this AI-based
command, but sooner or later, it pops up your new photo
with the plastic bag deleted. And it's kind of insane
that that actually works. I mean, it seems to understand
what I'm asking for. It knows what the plastic bag is. It knows what ""delete"" means. It goes in. It uses generative fill. It does all that. How many of you guys are
like family tech support, and somebody needs to Photoshop something, and they just send it to
you and ask you to do it? Now that family member might just be able to talk to their phone and have it do it themselves. I mean, they can even get carried away. I tried asking for some more random edits, like turning a cloudy sky blue, and it did a surprisingly good job of it. I also asked for it to
add things to the photo; it seemed to also have
no problem doing that. The limitations basically
seemed to be the same as what Magic Editor has been. So it doesn't really
like to mess with faces. But other than that, it's
kind of just free game. And this is coming to
Google Photos in general. This isn't just a Pixel 10 feature; this is coming to anyone who has Google Photos on their phone. So that's pretty sick. That's very Google. Now there's some other neat
stuff on the Pixel 10s, like the Pixel Journal app and live voice translate on phone calls that sounds remarkably
similar to my actual voice, but it's AI-generated
speaking a different language. All this stuff could potentially
be that one killer feature that makes people fall for and
stick with a Pixel this year, just like call screening
had been in the past. And that's the Pixel story. It's not the brutal,
super-high-horsepower raw numbers; it's just clever software. The smartest phone in the room again. And so, you can probably
see where this is going, but let's just talk about
Tensor for a second. Tensor G5, it's the newest
processor in all of these phones. It's a three-nanometer chip. And I don't think it's going
to make some magical leap to being Snapdragon 8
Elite levels of performance with this one-generation bump. I mean, I didn't get to run benchmarks, and so I will for my full review, so you can see exactly
how much better it is. And I get the sense that they
do want it to have better CPU and GPU performance to last year. But in theme with the rest of the phone, it's not the main focus. They will be focusing on TPU,
AI stuff, on-device models, and things like the
image signal processor. Now, is that a little bit disappointing? To me, a nerd, yeah, a little bit. But at the same time, these phones, as I'm using them in my first impressions, they feel pretty smooth and snappy. I do have to wonder how they'll age. But you know, bumping around the Pixel 10s with Material 3 Expressive and Android 16 and multitasking a little bit and just moving through all
kinds of random open apps, it was working quite well. So we shall see. Oh, and by the way, Google
also today is unveiling a new Pixel Watch 4, which
has an even brighter, larger, and much more domed display
that looks really cool. Plus, it charges much faster
on this new charging dock and has a 25% longer battery life. So that is very interesting. Plus some new Pixel Buds 2A
with active noise cancellation. So let me know in the comments what you guys are interested
in seeing for the full reviews. But definitely stay
tuned for those videos, 'cause they're coming up as soon as I get my hands on these phones. Should be very interesting. Thanks for watching. All right, a bit of a
unique sponsor segment here. As you can see in front of
me, I now have 10 Pixels, and I also have 10 of
channel sponsor dbrand's Prism 2.0 screen protectors. And I'm not usually a
huge screen protector guy, but I've been using these for
a little bit, and I like them, so I know how to install them. And the deal is, if I can
install 10 of these in a minute, then you guys are gonna
get a pretty crazy deal. So, Andrew, I'm gonna need a timer, and just let me know when to start. I'll do a countdown. All right, ready? Three, two, one, go. (plastic rustling) Okay, so 10 phones in a minute is about six seconds per phone. I just gotta keep at a good pace here, and I should be no problem. (plastic rustling) Obviously, these are very easy to install, so it would be pretty embarrassing if I didn't get them all in a minute. (plastic rustling) Perfectly with no bubbles. (plastic installers rattling) Done! (claps) Easy! Well, that was pretty sick. I think that unlocks a
little code tree down below, and now I have 10
perfectly skinned Pixels. All right, so the deal is
dbrand is gonna give you 42% off a Prism when you bundle it in with one of their Ghost
cases, which is also available and shipping now for the Pixel 10 series. So just add any Prism
and Ghost to your cart at the link below, use
code MKBHD at checkout, and get 42% off the Prism. (groovy upbeat music)","Pixel 10 is finally here - it's more flagship, but mostly still very Pixel.

2025-08-13,Top 5 Sports Tech I Actually Use!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7X5KukvABc,"[Music] Yeah, it's been a while since I talked about this. Uh, but that one throw away line in my Twitter bio is not a joke. I am actually a professional ultimate frisbee player. I swear. Actually, I'm playing for four different teams right now. New York Empire, the professional team in New York, the Pride of New York, aka Pony for club. Team USA for World Games, which is essentially the Olympics for sports that aren't yet in the Olympics. and team USA mix for the beach world championships later this year and all at the same time. So, it's kind of like a second full-time job at this point. So, I do think it's worth doing an entire separate video just explaining the sport and what it is and how much it means to me and how it's even possible to play for four different teams at the same time. But one of the most common questions that I get because of this job is what's the overlap like? Is there any tech in ultimate frisbee? Do these worlds combine ever at all? And I'll tell you right now, there is some overlap. You might have seen me in some pictures or highlights wearing an Apple Watch. I feel like I never take that thing off. There's also plenty of gimmicks that I've tried that I don't necessarily use anymore, like grippy socks for more traction or insoles in your cleats that are supposed to make you jump higher. So, this is just answering the question once and for all. This is the sports tech that I actually use. So, let's start with the watch. Yes, I wear an Apple Watch Ultra 2 while I play and while I train. Fun fact, and a lot of you have actually picked this up already. I wear it usually on my right wrist, which is backwards allegedly, uh, but while I live and while I train, and then I switch it to my left wrist while I play because I don't like the feeling of throwing with something on my right arm. Now, I have tried other fitness bands. I've tried the latest Whoop especially, which is way more focused on just the tracking and recovery and fitness stuff. It is just a dedicated band with no display. So, it's easier to wear while sleeping, just a little more purpose-built. But the Apple Watch is obviously a more everyday wearable type thing with a screen to show me notifications and I have it on all day and then when I go train, I can swap the band out and have a silicon band and then it's better for that. So, it's more multi-purpose. I think I've really just ended up liking it more because it it gifies the fitness part a lot. like it makes a big deal out of closing your rings every day, getting your steps in, getting the little trophies for different accomplishments. As silly as it sounds, winning fitness competitions against other friends with Apple Watches is motivating. And if you really like the Whoop stuff, there's actually an app called Athletic that takes the data collected by the watch and delivers a lot of the same info, recovery score, sleep, and strain, and exertion. It is also a subscription, but hey, so is a Whoop. Side note though, there are no group fitness challenges on the Apple Watch. You can one v one somebody in a fitness competition for a week, but there are no group fitness challenges without a third party app. Apple, get on that. Now, you know, as far as calorie counting, I'm not convinced that the Apple Watch is particularly accurate. But the real key for me is that it's inaccurate the same way every time. So, it for sure overounts. Like I don't think a frisbee practice is actually 3,600 calories. I don't even think that's possible. But I at least know that the workload is higher than the practice that reads only as 2,800 calories. So for me, for tracking, it's the Apple Watch. So for its versatility and gamification, the Apple Watch is sports tech that I actually use. Next up is a piece of tech that if you're an athlete, you might have already heard of, and it's for recovery, and it's the Normatch legs. So the theory is simple. Uh you play a sport or you have a lot of lower body workouts. You do a lot of running or jumping or lifting or landing or sprinting. Then you get these. So these normate are a wearable compression recovery system that helps to increase circulation which reduces inflammation and helps flush the lactic acid out of my legs. It's basically compressing your leg one section at a time and then it deflates and then rolls up again. and it just does it over and over again in a cycle. Sometimes I even put my feet further up like on a towel or pillows or something to help gravity assist the process. But basically after like 45 minutes of this going through over and over, I know I feel great, well recovered after. So between 2 days of a tournament or after a practice when I know I have another one the next day, I trust these a lot. I actually had the previous version which had a separate air compressor and then you had to attach these hoses to each leg to pump the air into them for compression, but this new version is much easier to travel with since the compressor and the batteries and everything are built into each leg and they wirelessly sync to each other. And then there are other versions of this on the Hyper Ice website. They have hips compression and they have arms on there. Depending on what sport you play, you might be interested in some of those other ones. I also realize that these are very expensive, but given how many times I use them, it's just proven to be worth it for me, for sure. Now, there is one other addition to their lineup that I'm slightly less sold on, but uh I've gotten to test them, so I'm going to include it anyway cuz they're interesting. Uh which is these things. This is the collab boot that they made with Nike. So these things, as ridiculous as they look, they have a purpose, which is compression and heat, specifically on the foot. So if you have any foot injuries or even even if you just play a sport where you cut a lot or you wear cleats and your feet hurt, then theoretically this could be interesting. The other thing about these though is when you're wearing the legs, you're basically immobilized. Like you can't go anywhere. Obviously, you're kind of occupied, which is usually fine. I'll be on my phone or my laptop and I can get work done. But if something is across the room, like my water bottle, then I got to stop them. I got to unzip them. I got to start over. That's kind of a bummer. So, the advantage of the shoes theoretically is, well, you just wear them like sneakers and then they're massaging just your feet. But really, that's about it. I mean, the tech is great. Again, they wirelessly sync to each other. You can choose the level of compression and the level of heat. And the highest level, three out of three, actually is too hot. It's kind of ridiculously hot. But this is only really useful when I need help specifically with the midfoot and the Achilles. Like that's where I can feel the bladder fill with air and actually apply real compression and that's where all the heat is happening. So this doesn't do anything for like plantar fascitis or anything around the toes as much as I wish I had something to do that. But if I ever need something around the midfoot or the Achilles, then I know that I can rely on these cuz they do actually do that. And I also have one more product from this company, which is the Hyper Ice knee sleeve, which is very specific. It's literally just a portable battery powered heating or cooling sleeve straight to the knee. It's great to travel with. Again, if you've had knee pain, especially with me, I've had patellar tendinitis. This thing is an MVP. and crazy timing. They actually just came out with this new one that I'm gonna try, which adds compression to the mix. Nice. All right. This one I wasn't expecting to use, but they randomly sent it to the studio one day and it turned out to be really solid. This is a mini massage gun made by Xiaomi. Now, Xiaomi basically makes everything, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised that they also make a mini massage gun. But yeah, a bunch of companies make almost this exact same thing. You've probably seen them before. Nice little soft tissue massage. Take it with me anywhere. It's great. Very small, very portable. Counts as sports tech, right? Uh and then also speaking of light and small and portable. My workout headphones of choice, which are these. And I love these things. They're basically perfect. These are my Power Beats Pro 2 in the mango color. And honestly, I couldn't make a better set of in-ear buds for working out. They have great sound, great seal in my ear, which is huge. Great battery life. They're lightweight. They have active noise cancellation. The hook is super functional. So, importantly, they actually stay in my ear. I don't know how anyone works out in heavy headphones. I've seen people like jogging around Manhattan with air literally AirPods Max on, which is, you know, more power to you, but I just want whatever I'm wearing when I'm working out to be as light as possible, including my cleats. So, I don't know if this is a sports tech either, but I'm throwing it in there. I have worn the same style of cleat every year I've played Ultimate since 2007, which is basically whatever the lightest weight soccer cleat I can find is. Usually that's Nike's Mercurial Vapor or Superflies. A single pair of cleats never last me more than one season. They kind of break in the same way every time, but actually my favorite pair of all time was this really specific pair that I had in 2019 with that stripe up the back. I was never able to find them again in my size literally one year after they came out. Makes me wish I bought like five pairs of them back when I had them in size 12 and a half. But now, you know, if anyone watching this happens to have a pair that they want to get rid of, hit me up cuz I miss those things. Either way, that's pretty much it. That is the overlap between tech and Ultimate, which is not massive, but I kind of like that about it. I feel like Ultimate Frisbee is my home away from being online all the time and being super immersed in tech. And I think that's really important for me to have. Also, the reason I'm posting this video now is if you're watching this now as it comes out, then that means that I am off to China to compete for Team USA in the World Games for Ultimate Frisbee. So, the World Games, like I said earlier, it's essentially the Olympics for sports not yet in the Olympics. It's every four years. you know, every country that goes sends 14 people. It's very selective, very high level, and uh should be pretty awesome. But I I'll put a link below to hopefully be following the tournament, maybe some broadcasts I can link, so if you want to watch it, you can. And I'm excited about that. And uh I also plan to make a video explaining just what Ultimate Frisbee is because I think that would also be helpful. So yeah, enjoy the summer. Hopefully, you're outside or enjoying a sport you love and found some of this helpful. And uh you know what else the summer is good for? Ridg's summer sweep stakes. You see, every summer channel sponsor Ridge hosts this huge giveaway. And this one's no different. Although this time there are two lucky winners instead of one. So double your chances to win one of the following. A Lamborghini Huracan Strato, which I actually reviewed on Autofocus. It's their off-road version of the Huracan. Same 610 horsepower, same 5.2 2 L V10, but with extra ground clearance and off-road tires and off-road accessories, and it's limited edition, or a Hennessy Velociraptor.

2025-08-08,Investigating the Tesla Robotaxi!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We2ZD0-IXPM,"Truly autonomous driving is one of the hardest technological problems to solve on planet Earth today for so many reasons. There's millions and millions of variables. No two roads are exactly alike. And the number of possible scenarios to navigate is almost infinite. And if you mess up, it could be seriously dangerous or cost someone their life. So, the stakes are high, the difficulty is high, and yet there are some companies that are trying to solve it. Now, up until this point, I've never ridden in a Whimo or a Tesla robo taxi. Just read about them. They're not available on the East Coast here. So, I've mostly just seen a bunch of videos on social media and a bunch of headlines. Whimo has been operating since 2015, and they're doing driverless autonomous taxi rides in a few cities now. Austin, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Phoenix, and LA. And then Tesla, despite recently announcing this whole cyber cab, they've actually started doing a super limited service of their own driverless taxis in regular Tesla Model Y's starting in Austin, Texas. The thing is, there's been a lot of chatter about both of these. Kind of like as if they're sports teams, like you have to pick one of them to root for and then you have to root against all the other ones. I definitely saw a small number of Tesla themed creators which were the first ones to get access to the Tesla robo taxis and they have been how do I say this? Uh they've been very forgiving of any shortcomings of the service. I've watched a handful of these videos. There's plenty of good stuff but also plenty of weird stuff and odd maneuvers and phantom braking. There's even a video of somebody getting dropped off in an intersection and saying >> it looks like we got dropped off right here at the corner. >> It's really something to see. And the cherry on top is since so many of them picked sides, they also have to hate Whimo and and post videos of other Whimos doing bad things to sort of even it out. Now, like I said, I've never used either, and I know neither of them is perfect, but I quite like the idea of getting into a nice, quiet, empty car and just having it safely take me to my destination. That sounds kind of nice. So, I was just curious how good these services actually are today. So, I got on a flight and I flew down to that geo fenced area of downtown Austin where there are both Whimos and robo taxis to find out. For the Tesla robo taxi, they have a super limited app that you need to be given access to. I got access. So, now to try to learn as much as possible, I took a bunch of rides with both of these all day and took plenty of notes along the way. All right, Austin, Texas. It is hot out here. Uh, but it's only going to get hotter, so we might as well just jump right into it. It's time for my first robo taxi ride. I've got the app on my phone and I'm in the geoence location. So, let's do it. And so, I guess let's just book a ride. [Music] Ride is on the way. There it is. It's a dark gray Model Y like we expected. Put a blinker on. [Music] Okay. Yeah, it's great. Everything's normal. Robo taxi. Okay. >> Hello. >> Hello. Okay. Before we start, if you don't mind, I'll just need to verify the the robo taxi app, please. >> Oh, okay. Start ride. So, we arrive in 9 minutes. This is our route. So, it's kind of nice that we get this uh little screen at the bottom. We do have a pullover button. I don't think we'll need that. It's actually interesting cuz the car map has us going straight up to that intersection, but also it has its blinker on right now as if it's going to turn left. So, it's decided to go left. That seems fine. The map readjusts. It looks like it's one of those edge cases. Time to see what it does. It puts the blinker on, goes around. That was good. The visuals on the screen are pretty encouraging. I guess it's it's just cuz there's a there's a chair in front of me, which is usually all I see during a ride anyway, so there might as well be a person in the chair, even though there is no person in the chair. Sitting in the left rear seat, after a while, it just kind of felt like I got used to it. It felt like I was a passenger to a really short driver who wasn't saying anything. But as you noticed, there's obviously still a person in the car. This here is Tesla's safety monitor. Every Tesla robo taxi has one, and that person has a few special buttons they can press on the main display. One to pull over and one to stop in lane in case they notice anything going wrong. They all also seem to keep a rather firm grip on the door opening button for some reason. Some people think it's another way to safely disengage FSD. Thankfully though, none of these buttons were needed to be pressed during any of my rides. This pretty normal so far, right? Please exit safely. >> All right. >> Thanks you guys. >> Thank you. >> Have a great day. Peace. >> Fundamentally, it went totally fine. The car showed up. We got in. It drove like a normal person would. It navigated the streets and even some slightly odd scenarios very confidently. I did a few more rides around Austin just to various places. And in general, it was confident. It was impressive. And the pickups and drop offs were mostly seamless, as they would be with a human driver, except for one where it drove about 50 yards past me for some reason instead of stopping next to me to pick me up. A human probably wouldn't have done that. It does kind of take away a little bit of the magic of it if there's still someone in the car. Like, we know it's not going to be that way forever, but there is just a person in the front seat. It felt like a normal passenger ride, which I think is the bar. That's the success. But now it's time to try a Whimo. All right. I've never ridden in a Whimo before in Austin. It's built into the Uber app. So, I'm going to try to call a Whimo by calling a comfort electric. Let's try it. And you actually don't know if you're going to get a Whimo or not until you get matched with one. There is a button you enable in your account once you land in Austin to allow you to get matched with Whimos, but it turns out it's still kind of by chance. So, from my experience, it's about 80% regular drivers and then once or twice out of 10, you'll get a Whimo. Okay, it's not going to walk up to me. That's fine. Unlock the car. >> Good to see you, Marcus. >> Just greeted me. >> Start the ride. >> Heading to Austin Public Library. Please make sure your seat belt is fastened. >> Happy Friday. >> Okay, so same idea, but nobody in the car. So, this front screen is just showing our arrival time, which makes sense. But then this bottom screen is closer to you, and you can look at the actual visuals. And I can also play music or pull over. Or if I swipe over here, looks like I can look at the route, change the temperature, all that other fun stuff. Oh, we're cooking. This one's confidently navigating the same way. We just had a stop sign. We got a bit of a narrow road here. There's a car parked and just confidently drove around it, used its blinkers and everything. It took it easy and pulled to the size that the truck could go first. That was pretty good. >> You're here. Please make sure >> similar overall driving style and confidence in the Whimo. The Whimo felt maybe 25% less aggressive or assertive and more cautious in general, but the the Tesla was very similar capability-wise. And my rides weren't entirely perfect either. On one ride, when it got to my destination, which was right on the other side of the street, it blew right past it to try to do this huge eight minute route to turn around, another thing I don't think a human driver would have done, but I did end up using the pullover button to end the ride early to avoid wasting those extra minutes and miles. Fascinating. So, okay, doing those experiences back to back was, I think, just was fascinating. It was eye opening, very interesting. Uh, and you know, say what you want about self-driving cars as a whole because some people love them, some people hate them, but as a tech product, it is fascinating seeing these two different approaches to solving the same problem. So, let's start with Whimo. Basically, every Whimo so far has been a Jaguar Ipace, an electric SUV that hardly anyone actually buys, but they're decent. You know, solid room in the second row, all-wheel drive, 246 mi of range on a full charge. But of course, you can see they're all heavily modified with these sensors all over it. On top of the vehicle, on the front, on the back, many of them lidar to help the onboard computers sort of build a picture of the world around them while it's driving in real time. I've seen a couple estimates for how much it might cost to build a Whimo. Uh, as far as I can tell, there's no official number that they're giving anyone, but you know, clearly it's significantly more expensive than just your standard Jaguar. And it also almost completely covers the sunroof. So, you might not even know an iPace has a sunroof if you've been riding in Whimos this whole time because of all that hardware above you. Now, as a passenger, am I fine with a bunch of extra hardware and maybe more of an eyesore to potentially be more safe? Yeah, of course. But you'll see where I'm going with this when I talk about the Tesla robo taxi in a bit. One thing that struck me though is it does feel as a customer like the Whimo actually is a bit further along in like the overall experience of of a ride. And I what I mean by that is it just feels like it's a little bit more well thought out in some aspects because they've clearly had more stuff happen. So from the placement of the unlock button and the open trunk button in the app so the car stays locked for anyone else and nobody can get in the car if they didn't call it. You know the stickers on the steering wheel because you know confused people have probably tried to touch the wheel all the time. And when I got in the car, there's this voice that greets me by name and explains what's going on and how it's an autonomous ride and I'm not being recorded. The cameras around the car are just for driving, etc., etc. And the UI on the screens is nicely laid out. Little stuff. And then obviously there's no one in the car, which is huge, especially if the whole point of someone opting into a service like this is to not have to deal with people. The Tesla robo taxi, on the other hand, well, it's just a Tesla Model Y with some decals on it. And this is really interesting. This is actually my first time riding in this new refreshed version of the Model Y. And yeah, they're great. It's pretty obvious why they've been one of the most popular vehicles on Earth. The suspension in this generation is better than last time. It's quiet inside. You can actually see out the sunroof. And they've got over 300 mi of range on a charge for pretty cheap, which to me feels just more modern and obviously less of an eyesore and clearly cheaper, which is potentially more scalable without all the extra sensors on it. And you know, Tesla software in the car is really good, too. I could go in and play YouTube or Spotify on that back screen or any number of the other media services if I wanted to. But also, Tesla was way more reliant on this safety monitor employee sitting in the passenger seat. Like when I got in the car, it's not a voice from the computer. The person actually asks to see the app to verify that I was actually the one that called the car. And clearly, that would be the person to tell me not to touch the steering wheel if I was to do anything stupid. But then, yeah, as a passenger, you're just kind of sharing a ride with another person, just choosing for the person to not be holding the steering wheel for the sake of helping them beta test this service, which feels a little more silly. Funny enough, Tesla, like the other day, as of when I'm recording this, started testing in like a new San Francisco geoence area, but they're not legally allowed to test without someone in the driver's seat. So, they're just running Tesla Model Y's around with someone in the driver's seat ready to take over, but they'll enable FSD. I don't know why that's so funny to me. Either way, as a as a newly experienced rider in the driverless cabs of each of these services and and generally an optimist about new technology, here's my take. So exciting new technologies always follow, I've talked about it before, this curve of like a really steep improvement at the beginning and then a tapering off when it's good enough for the masses and doesn't make massive leaps anymore. And these Tesla and Whimo are both really early at the beginning. Maybe Whimo's a little further ahead, but they're so early that they're in small geoenced areas in select cities and not on highways. And some of them still have a person in the car. Both of them definitely have remote support options in case anything goes wrong. But the point is they're both insanely early on this curve, which is exciting, but they're also both very cautious. I think the dream of driverless cars successfully sharing the road with human drivers is fascinating, even if it's only a step on the way towards every car being autonomous. Driving-wise, both the robo taxis and the Whimos that I took performed admirably. They dealt with pedestrians and lights and other cars and construction vehicles. And that's just in my one day of testing. But just because nothing bad happened to me doesn't mean nothing bad happens. Trust me, there's lots of videos of both Tesla robo taxis and Whimos doing some stupid stuff. So the real challenge for these companies is scaling up that curve without pushing too far. Like, as far as I'm concerned, it's a good thing that both companies are being as safe as possible. Whimo is using tons of expensive LAR sensors all over their car to try to be as safe as possible. Good. Tesla paying safety monitors to ride along inside every driverless car with a vice grip on a kill switch on the door handle. Good. Like, there are so so many edge cases that these cars will encounter as they rack up the millions of miles of driving. construction, closed lanes, busted roads, sloppy road markings, weird signs, flooding, snow covered roads. Like, anything is possible. It's like how there's a brand new sentence typed into Google every day. Like, these cars are going to encounter brand new driving situations that no human driver has ever encountered before, and they're going to have to navigate them effectively and cautiously and safely. That's hard, especially for a non-human driver. It's funny. I was talking to an Uber driver because one of the many rides I took in Austin that day was with a regular driver. And he was talking about how there's uh at certain intersections in the city of Austin, Texas, there's certain sensors that you have to drive over and trip just the right way to get the light to change. And Whimos miss that sensor all the time and then just sit there blocking traffic. And he's had to drive up and trip the sensor for it so that it could relieve the pressure of traffic. Crazy stuff. You'd never know. My hope is just that both these companies and any others joining this challenge for that matter try to scale this curve as you know safely and methodically as possible. Like I've heard all the talk on Twitter about how oh maybe Tesla without all those expensive LAR sensors will be able to scale faster because the cars are cheaper. Maybe. But if it comes at the expense of any safety doesn't matter. It won't matter. Like if you can imagine if there's even one bad incident or if someone gets hurt, you can see the headlines coming from a mile away, how far that sets them back. So it's easy to make fun of, but the geoenced areas and the safety drivers are actually a good thing. And I don't think either of these companies should be in any particular rush to be the first to drop these training wheels, but they're also businesses that are in competition with each other. So, on the upside, you know, both of these technologies are clearly pretty amazing. You can tell just by asking someone who grew up more than about 40 years ago what they think about self-driving cars and how they actually work. Super impressive, super complicated, very cool. Now, on the downside, you know, people on Twitter famously like to pick sides like sports teams. Like, if you like one of them, then you must dislike the other one. Like, you have to root for one to succeed and the others to fail. It's I I kind of think robo taxi versus Whimo Twitter is worse than iPhone versus Android ever was. But look at where we are now. iPhone and Android, they compete, but they also kind of coexist and push each other to be better constantly. And I don't think that's such a bad future here either. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. [Music]","I flew to Texas to take a bunch of Tesla Robotaxi and Waymo rides. Here's what I found

2025-07-29,iPadOS 26: Ready for Laptop Duty?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AphNalSmvlk,"(upbeat music) - So when iPadOS 26 got
unveiled at WDC this year, it looked like a game changer. And I wasn't the only one saying that. Many, many people had the same feeling watching all this new stuff. It felt like everybody on the internet who was waiting for years for
Apple to just do the thing, just watched Apple finally do the thing. They just made the iPad a computer. But, you know, this is Apple
we're talking about here and there's no way they would just turn the iPad into a Mac, right? They still need to sell Macs. Obviously there's gotta be
some kind of catch, right? So I did what any logical
tech reviewer would do. I installed iPadOS 26 beta as soon as it was available on my iPad. And then I took my MacBook
Pro that I've used daily out of my backpack. So I've been living with
the iPad in its place for the past three weeks or so now to be able to give you a real answer. So first things first. I already loved my iPad
before this update. Like full disclosure, it was one of my favorite pieces of tech, and I'll also admit that
I didn't use it that much because when you also have a
MacBook Pro readily available to do any work tasks and stuff that I need to get
done outside of the studio, this just kind of became like
a glorified media machine. Like lots of YouTube video
watching, lots of web browsing, some occasional email or Slack. And then once in a while, I'll have some fun with image editing or playing a game or two. But again, if I have my laptop with me, which I almost always do, then this extremely powerful
iPad often went underused. So I would consider this update a success if I can stop carrying
my MacBook Pro with me. Except for editing. I know I'm probably always
gonna need that for editing just based on my workflow. But for everything else, I wanted to see if the iPad could do it. So that's what I did and I was actually pretty
excited to try this. Now the thing is I feel
like many YouTubers have taken on this exact challenge before with previous versions of
iPadOS over the past few years. They've probably used the same
title of this video before. ""Can this iPad be a laptop?"" ""Can the iPad be my full-time productivity machine as a student?"" ""Can it be my only computer?"" ""What is a computer?"" Each one of those videos details the walls that you run into when you
try to do computer-like things on the system that is iPadOS. With this latest update, some
of those walls are now gone, some of those walls are
definitely still there. So here's an example. The thing you've probably
heard the most about is this new window management
menu bar and all this stuff. And it is awesome, or at least it's dramatically
better than before. It breaks down the wall of multitasking with several windows
open, easier than ever. Literally any app you open on the iPad, you can drag the corner
to resize the window to whatever size you want and then you can just go crazy opening a bunch of overlapping windows, moving them around, going back and forth and multitasking to your heart's content. It's never been quicker or easier to get into
this multi window state, which feels very Mac-like. And then there's plenty of tricks to managing the windows once you're there. Like you can flick a window to each side to take up half the screen. That's super useful. You can double tap the top of any app for it to go back to full screen. And then at any time, you can swipe down to see the menu bar for an app, which looks exactly like it would on a Mac and includes the Stoplight
window controls in the corner to maximize or minimize or
close something on the spot. And also, I gotta be honest, I don't know that there's a
difference between minimizing and closing an app on the iPad. 'Cause when I close an
app, it just goes away. If I minimize an app, it just goes away. But the minimizing version
feels very Mac-like. So hey, give the people what they want. But I think the most important
thing to remember here is this multi window mode is just that. It's a mode that you can
easily flip on and off with a single touch in the Control Center. So I found this super useful. When it's off, you know, apps open full screen every time like they always did, the handle at the bottom corner is gone and you can pull down
from anywhere at the top to get notifications or Control Center and swipe across the bottom
to flip between recent apps. This is the iPad we've
all always been used to and it still works exactly like that. But if you go to Control Center and go into windowed
apps mode with one click, suddenly that resizing anchor appears, use it wherever you want. Also swiping down from the
middle now brings up the menu bar instead of notifications,
unless you swipe down again or swipe down from the far left. And multitasking remembers
groups of windows and even window sizes as you're working. It's very powerful, even
more than Stage Manager was. You can now have up to eight windows open at the same time instead of four. But you know, it's also a
little different from a Mac. For example, I noticed just
as you're resizing windows, some apps respond instantly as
you're dragging your finger. So you can just drag them to
size and move on really quick. But some apps don't
respond quite in real time as you're dragging your finger. They kind of go in stages. So you might have to resize a few times to get it exactly the way you want it. But then of course, you know, on a Mac, there is no window limit as far as I know, that you could easily reach anyway. So you can go way crazier. There's more spaces for multitasking and way more, probably more RAM and just more flexibility in general. But the ceiling for
multitasking on an iPad is higher than ever before. By the way, I was curious
how this would look on an iPad Mini or if they
would like restrict any of this multi window stuff or having a ton of stuff open at once. But nope, you can go just as crazy with tiny floating windows all
over the iPad Mini's display. You can knock yourself out. It's way less useful here
because there's way less pixels but confirmed, they still let you do it. Anyway, as I continued to use
the iPad through these weeks, it would continue to be mostly pain-free. Lots of using it like the
usual like full screen, then occasional blitzes of
multitasking once in a while. And here and there, there
would be one computer-like task that I'd have to really think through and then it would be a little
bit slower and kind of a pain, but then I could figure it out. I could basically eventually get it done. Like I got sent a PDF on Slack that I had to sign and send back. Okay, on a computer that's pretty easy. But here, let's see, open it. Okay, Open in browser, Share, More, okay, Markup. Then I sign it and then I
save it to the iPad again and then go back to Slack and attach it. Okay, success, like there's no wall there. You can definitely still do the thing. It just takes a little
bit of extra thinking, a little more friction and
some final management stuff. But that's scattered throughout the days. And all of this made me realize, you know, with the apps that I use and the workflows that I've built, the question isn't actually, ""Can I replace my laptop with an iPad?"" Because yes, I can. The question really became ""Do I want to?"" Because sometimes yeah, I do, but also sometimes I don't want to. Like there's many, many moments
of the iPad being better and more enjoyable to use than any laptop. It's this awesome
touchscreen-first device. You know, you have one
app full screen at a time. To me, that just means like, I can't get distracted
by Discord or Twitter or just other windows I have open. So I can just lock in on
one or two things at a time. The iPad's display is
beautiful, it's super thin, and this thing is a pound
lighter than my laptop, so my backpack feels lighter
just carrying the iPad around. It sounds subtle, but
it really felt great. And this stuff makes me want
to use the iPad all the time for as much as I can. But every once in a while, like I said, I'd run up
against that little wonky thing or this tiny limitation here or there. Like on the iPad, I can't
have two audio sources playing at the same time. So I can't have music
playing in the background while I also watch a YouTube video while researching something. I can only do one at a time. Dang. Or when I'm trying to work without a table on a couch or something. The iPad's keyboard case, it's good. It's better than it's ever been. There's a real cursor now, it's fantastic. But compared to a laptop, like this thing is still really top heavy and kind of clunky and weird to use and there's less metal,
more silicon and rubber and it's just harder to open and close. Dang. Also, the Files app,
the new Files app is great. Way better than ever before. You can plug in external storage and sort through things
easily, import/export, view information about your files, connect to servers, the whole thing. But it can sometimes be
just a little confusing where files actually are. Like when I AirDrop photos
and media to the iPad and it doesn't go into
the Downloads folder like it would on a Mac. Just slightly off. Dang. So look, I couldn't be more clear. I love the iPad's display
and how good it looks and how good it sounds
and how thin and sleek and fun it is to use this
touchscreen everywhere. And it's more capable than
ever with this new software. That's a fact. But the iPad's strength is
actually its versatility. So my take is I still don't
think the iPad was designed to replace a laptop for most
people most of the time. But I do think it is capable of becoming almost an entire laptop with the right accessories. But then look at what you've created, like adding a mouse and a keyboard, a display, the Folio case, like the whole thing
you're carrying around is suddenly basically the same thickness and weight as a laptop again. So you might as well just get the laptop. But the iPad can also be
a great media machine. It's a really nice lean-back experience instead of the typical
lean-forward experience, if that makes sense? It also happens to have
cameras on the back so you can take photos and videos with it. It also has cellular, which
a lot of computers don't. It also happens to have
an awesome stylus support. So it can be your handwritten notepad or it can be an artist's canvas. All of these things that computers and laptops typically don't have. So that's the point. It's just more versatile than
a single laptop would be. So if you're trying to answer
the question, you know, should you get an iPad
instead of a laptop? Well, then I'm gonna just
stop you right there. If all you need is a computer, then no, I think you
just get the computer. It's designed to be better just as that. Better balance, better
hinge, better keyboard. That's what it's made for. But if you want something that
can be most of a computer, but also do all these other things, then just like, think
of the top five things you're gonna do on this machine and think, would you rather do those
five things on a tablet or on a computer? And then there's your answer. So no doubt the ceiling
has been raised for what an iPad is capable of as a computer, but it's still an iPad,
(upbeat music) which is pretty sweet too. Thanks for watching. Also, if you wanna check out
the rest of my iOS 26 coverage and all the other stuff
that's new with that, check out my iOS 26 video. It'll be right here. It's all the Liquid Glass and
the new features and stuff. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. (upbeat music continues)","Is the iPad Pro finally a laptop? I think the question is now different...

2025-07-24,iOS 26 Hands-On: Liquid Glass!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXrcFeuYtq8,"(bright music) - All right, we gotta talk
about the latest version of iOS coming soon to an iPhone near you, 'cause this one is a pretty big update. I've been running the
latest beta of iOS 26 on my iPhone for a little while now. Yes, the number now
matches the year, kinda. And the public beta is out now too, which means you can test it as well. And this is the major visual overhaul that we've been hearing about for so long. If you're a subscriber of this channel, you've heard about this before. If you watch the podcast,
you've known it's coming, and now it's landed in
the form of Liquid Glass. But there also is a lot more to it. So lemme walk you through the
top five features of iOS 26 in order of how big of a deal it is. 'Cause that feels right. Also, if you haven't already
subscribed to this channel, get subbed so you can
stay on top of this stuff. Let's get into it. So number five, the new camera app. So it's been years since
I've been able to say this, but Apple has redesigned
the whole camera app. They've updated some
really important things, and here's why it's really good. On the surface it looks
even more simplified just because it is. You know, it's just the shutter
button, the zoom buttons, and then a few other buttons at the top, and then the photo and
video picker at the bottom, then everything else is hidden, which is probably great for most people. So then when you want
to go to change modes, you can see that there's
actually more of them available and then you can actively
slide between them like you always have. It's just, it's harder
to see all of the modes available to you since they're hidden. But what I really like is if
you hit that top left button, it actually lets you just pick all of the format settings that you want instead of having to tap
it over and over again to cycle through every setting. It's so much better for video. Instead of having to tap the
frame rate over and over again to cycle to 24, then 30, then 60, just pick the one you want, finally. And then for all the rest of the settings, just hit that top right box, or even easier pro tip, just swipe up. So these are where the settings are that you are less likely to change, which is why they're a bit more hidden. But that is a strong
reorganization in my opinion. So the number four is a big
update to visual intelligence. See, Apple Intelligence
has been hit or miss since it was first announced. Honestly, mostly miss. A lot of things that aren't super useful, Genmoji, Image Playground, whatever. But visual intelligence
is one of the things that I've thought has
had a lot of promise, it has a high ceiling. And it's been in the form so far of just looking through your camera and being able to visually identify things that you're pointing it at. But now this update includes
onscreen things as well into visual intelligence. And while it's not super good yet, I do think that's important, and I do think the ceiling
just got much higher just to have this included. Because see, on Android we've had circle to
search for some time now, and it's good, it's incredibly useful. You hold down on the home bar and then circle whatever
you want with your finger, it Google searches that, pulls up information on
it, identifies it for you. It's kind of like a
superpower, it's awesome. And Apple has now kind of
built something like that into the iPhone. The funny thing is they've
built it into the screenshot UI. So you hold down power and
volume up to take a screenshot, and then you'll see some new
things around the outside, an Ask button, an Image Search button, or you can literally
circle with your finger to search something with Google. And it does a reverse image search, basically the same thing as Android. That is super useful when it works. And then you can also use Ask to literally ask ChatGPT about the image. It's not the fastest thing in the world, it's a little imprecise. It's also been a little buggy for me. But I do see a lot of potential
here for actually, you know, very useful AI stuff, something that Apple Intelligence
is desperately in need of since, you know, Image Playground is just
not cutting it for me. There's also, if you happen
to use Apple Calendar and you happen to take a photo of or have a picture of an
event poster of some kind, something with a date and a time on it, then you can jump to the screenshots UI. And then if you wait a few seconds depending on your
internet connection, boom, an Add to your Calendar button appears. And that'll add it to your Apple Calendar. And if you hit edit, you can
actually see it's pretty good about getting inputted details
right, start time, end time, description, location, et cetera. It's actually pretty impressive. I'm just gonna need this stuff to now get a little bit more robust. Let me add to my Google Calendar or some other default
calendar if I want to. Or let the chatbot when
I ask about something be Gemini if I want, or
Perplexity or Claude or whatever. I know none of this stuff is
ever actually gonna happen, but I can dream, right? So then number three, the phone app. You know, once upon a time phones made this thing
called a phone call. And you know what's crazy? A lot of people don't this,
but our smartphones today actually still can make phone calls. I know, it's crazy. I avoid them at all costs,
but if you can't avoid them, you might as well have a good phone app. And once again, the iPhone inherits two of
the best Google Pixel features because call screening
is pretty damn useful. So now if you have it turned
on, it will screen any call from an unknown number
not in your contacts. So if someone new calls
you, they'll hear this. - [iPhone] Hi, if you record your name and reason for calling, I'll see if this person is available. - And then whatever they
say gets transcribed so you can see it. Hi, I'm a delivery person,
can you let me in, please? And then once they stop talking, you can either answer that phone call or send a canned response
to leave a voicemail and then it records that voicemail for you to listen to later. Just all of this very helpful
for weeding out, you know, semi-convincing spam callers. And then the other one is Hold Assist, basically the same thing
as the Pixel's Hold For Me where it detects if you're on hold and then gives you a button
to just hold for you. And then when it detects that
the hold session is over, the music stops playing or
whatever, the human comes back, it'll send you a notification and then let you pick up
right where you left off. So you don't have to just
sit on the phone on hold. So that's two of the most
useful Pixel features. Welcome to the party, iPhone friends. And there's also a new
unified phone app layout that combines favorites,
recents, and voicemails all into one place,
which just makes sense. And then this phone app is also coming to iPad and Mac as well, so you can sync this
all across everything. So then number two is
the new Apple CarPlay. There has been a massive
update to CarPlay. And I know not everyone who
uses the iPhone uses CarPlay, but those who do are very
aware of its shortcomings. And so imagine how happy I was when I was testing this new
beta and I got a phone call and it didn't take up the entire screen. Finally, it's about damn time. Now, not only that, when you get a text, you can also actually hold down and react with the standard Tapbacks. Believe it or not, you couldn't do that with any older version
of iOS with CarPlay. And there's a few things
like a new set of widgets over to the left of the dashboard, so you can pick on your phone
which widgets show up here. And I found that the most
useful ones are like, media or maps, just some
things that are nice to have. And live activities can
appear in CarPlay as well. So just those things are a massive quality of life improvement. Plus there's a little bit of
a new design, as you can see. And none of this is even
mentioning CarPlay Ultra, which only really works on
like, one Aston Martin so far. So for the six of you watching
this that have that car, sorry, don't really have
much to say about that yet. But before I get to number one, since this is such a big update,
here are some other things that didn't make my list but that are still actually
pretty big and worth mentioning. So the photos app that everyone hates got an update to kind of halfway fix it, which is now just that it
defaults to the library view, which is just all your
latest photos and videos, which is what we all
wanted the first time. But collections is still an option there for all the old chaos that you can dive into whenever you want. And, okay, there's this wild new feature where you can open up just
about any picture on your iPhone as long as it has a clear
subject and background, then you hit that little
spatial scene button. And when you do, the iPhone
scans it for a second and then turns into a
responsive 3D-ish image. So it's separating the
background from the foreground and literally filling
in behind the subject so you can sort of peek around behind it by moving your phone around. It's so good. It's really, really good. You can set these images
as your phone lock screen. So the clock kind of sits
nicely behind the subject. You know, ordinarily this
would just be such a gimmick, but it's so clean that I actually don't put it
in the gimmick bucket anymore. It's super well done. And then messages, okay,
messages gets a few neat things like other messaging apps
have had for a while. Like you can add backgrounds to threads or have inline polls for
iMessage conversations or group chat individual
typing indicators. Cool. And there's also now
live translation features built into messages,
FaceTime, and the phone app, which all work offline fully. That's huge, 'cause
all of these languages, each one that you download
from my experience is a few hundred megabytes,
and then it works whether you have an
internet connection or not. And then come to think of it, a lot of these actually
come from other places or at least have been
available other places, but it's gonna be nice to have
it on the iPhone now anyway. You can choose your alarm snooze duration. You can just pick a number
other than nine minutes, which it's been for forever. And also now if you're
charging your iPhone, it finally will actually estimate how much longer it will
take to charge to 100%, an absolute classic from
Android 10 years ago. And my nerdy personal favorite, an audio input selector
in the Control Center. Just something I personally
will get a lot of use out of, love to see it. But then the obvious
number one here in iOS 26 is Liquid Glass. This redesign of the entire
OS from top to bottom in this new material design
style of transparency and refractions and reflections. And it's kind of polarizing, actually. Some people love it, some people hate it. It's so polarizing actually that Apple has started
walking some of it back. So originally the idea is
just to unify the aesthetic among all of Apple's platforms, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and really centering
it all around visionOS with the frosted glass
windows and the shadows and reflections of the real environment that your windows live in. So we saw a lot of that in the keynote. I think this pulling down the lock screen, just the way it's totally unnecessarily but super impressively
distorting everything and reflecting the light based
on the colors underneath it and the angles that it hits, the theoretical layers of
glass that I'm pulling down, I think this encapsulates it all. This is what Liquid Glass is all about. But there are some concerns, mainly around some stuff that
I brought up pretty early, which is around readability. And a lot of this is what's
contributing to the walking back that Apple has done since
that original unveil, which is like everything is clear, everything is super liquidy. And now we're on Beta 3. And there's more places in
the OS with slightly more, you know, background blurring
and slightly less transparency just to make some text actually readable and a bit less chaotic. So there's still the dramatic stuff like the all-clear icons. You can have a clear icon,
clear widget home screen, which is, okay, it's
impressive because on Android how many times have you
seen an icon theme pack where like, one or two icons gets left out and it just doesn't quite work? But this theme engine just
works with every icon and widget right out the box. But then again, that's all
this really feels like it is, especially with the clear home screen is just a theme that you
might apply or might not. Whether you like it or not, you do have to admit it is a
really, really good, detailed, well-executed theme engine. But then, so there are some
other parts of this that I like. You know, the new lock
screen I think is dope. You've probably seen the
extended clock by now. Long press it, drag it around,
make it as tall as you want. And then once you set that,
it compresses dynamically to respond to, you know, scrolling notifications underneath it. Super nice, fades behind
subjects into backgrounds. It's awesome. My favorite part of this new design is definitely the lock screen. But some other parts, meh. Eh, I don't know. Like, I've personally always been a fan of clean, flat design. I don't, maybe that's
just me, that's my bias. I know that's what I prefer. So you know, the extremely
glassy UI elements, like quick settings, you
know, the volume slider, these bubbly things, I
personally don't love them. But I'm sure over time
we'll all get used to this. But then some other parts just look straight up weird sometimes. Like they obviously need
to try to keep things as legible as possible, and I think they're gonna
continue to update it. Like they're actively,
they're moving things between dark and light mode
depending on what's behind it, like if the content
underneath is dark or light. And sometimes it can get wonky, especially with more complex backgrounds. You know, versus imagine if it was against a clean, flat background. It would be a lot more boring. But this is definitely a way
more characterful aesthetic, so you can't accuse this of being boring. Some people also have
pointed out to me on Twitter that there is a reduced
transparency setting in Accessibility. And so when you click that, most of the transparency goes away, or it kind of goes from Liquid Glass to sort of frosted glass in most places. So if you do want to turn
it off, that is available. But I am so interested now
to see if other companies try to copy this, this aesthetic thing. I mean, we know these companies
copy each other a lot. And it would be super obvious if one of them tried to copy it. But I don't know, is this
gonna be a sort of beginning of divergence for these softwares, where one of 'em is clean and
flat, one of 'em is bubbly, one of them is material view? Very curious to hear your thoughts. And lemme know if you are a
Liquid Glass lover or hater, drop a comment below. Thanks for watching. Catch you on the next one. Peace. (bright music)","Liquid glass(ish) and much more, coming to an Phone near you.

2025-07-09,Samsung Z Fold/Flip 7 Impressions: Major Upgrades!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMou1qUMHC4,"[Music] So, tick tock. The tick tock upgrade cycle is a classic. Last year, it felt like Samsung barely updated the Fold 6 and the Flip 6. They got new chipsets, sure, but other than that, almost changed nothing. Tick. But now this year, we have a new Galaxy Zfold 7 and Z Flip 7, and there are actual meaningful hardware updates this time. So, talk, I guess. So, welcome to your hands-on and first look at the latest generation of foldables from Samsung. Now, most of my thoughts here are going to be on the Fold, the big one, because Samsung has made some actually noticeable changes to a lot of this phone, and it's kind of going to hit one of either two ways. One, if you're not really in the phone world very much, in which case, hi, welcome to a phone video. Uh, this is going to be amazing because it's a brand new super thin ultra light foldable phone. Super cool. If you are in the phone world though and you've seen a lot of these videos before and you see what the other companies overseas are doing with their ultra thin foldables, then it's going to feel like hm Samsung's catching up. Either way you slice it, it is a big difference with the Fold 7. They've made it way thinner and way lighter. Each side unfolded is a little over 4 mm and so the whole thing closed is only 8.9 mm this time. And they've worked on simplifying and strengthening and thinning up the components on the inside. So, the hinge, the chassis, etc. So, the whole thing weighs 215 grams. That's actually lighter than an S25 Ultra. And all of this is in the spirit of being a much more usable slab phone when it's closed. So, the difference versus last year of just holding the phone and using it closed is very noticeable. It's barely thicker than a USB type-C port on each side. The buttons and the fingerprint reader are literally thinner to fit on the rail. I've talked about other foldables in the past being more usable while they're closed because of different aspect ratios and different size choices. But I am loving this new folds form factor because when it does unfold, it still unfolds into one of the biggest tablets you can fit in your pocket. 8 in now corner to corner. So they've made everything about it folded better. And they've also improved the full-size open usage as well. Plus, it's running 1 UI 8 on Android 16 out the box. So, all the improvements that the latest version of Android has to make big screen multitasking and multi-wind better will all be here. In the wide world of foldables, there's different reasons why you might choose different foldables. Some are shorter and squatter, so they're more reachable and better closed, but not as good open. Some are taller and thinner, so not as good closed, but when you open it, the screen's way bigger. This update from Samsung made it better at both closed and open usage. That's sick. So then on the theme of hardware improvements, one of the challenges for these foldables because they're so thin on each side is they never quite have room for flagship cameras. And with this Fold 7, that's still kind of true, but the gap is way closer because they have put in the S25 Ultra's main 200 megapixel camera in the new Fold. The glass and optics around it are slightly thinner to make it fit, but that is essentially a true flagship camera and all the pixel peeping benefits that come with it on a fold. I've loved this camera for months now. Now, the 12 megapixel ultrawide and the 10 megapixel 3x telephoto are also still smaller than flagship size. So, it's not fully on the level of a slab phone camera system, but to be fair, those are lesser used cameras and the majority of your photos are going to come from the primary camera. So, all of those are going to look better. The only downside really being that this camera I think now is gonna have to take my trophy for the most I've ever seen a phone rock on a table with no case on it. This one is absolutely diabolical. There's also an improved slightly wider angle 10 megapixel selfie camera in the inside screen as well. It's good news in the camera department. But speaking of the inside of this phone, there's also now the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip inside. And uh fun fact, and I don't know if this is true, but I think it is. The Snapdragon 8 Elite 4 Galaxy, the special version of their chip, sells so much volume that I think it actually out sells all of the standard Snapdragon 8 Elites, which kind of makes the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy the standard chip because there's more of them. Probably means nothing, but it was entertaining to me. But performance-wise, as you'd expect with the limited time I've gotten to play with this thing, it's pretty great. Very smooth. 12 gigs of RAM alongside that chip, too, since this is a phone you expect to multitask on. And the 1 TB version actually gets 16 gigs of RAM. So, all the Galaxy AI tools, whether you use them a tiny bit once in a while or use them all the time, they're all fast and they're all ideally improving over time. Samsung's actually talked to big game about their image editor getting even better with background object removal, which is kind of crazy considering how much better they already are than some of the competition. But it isn't all perfect, though. I've clocked three downgrades with this new generation, and I'll I'll do them in order of how big of a deal I think they are. So, first of all, the smallest deal, they removed S Pen support. So, the last one actually supported the S Pen. This one doesn't. You know, I guess they kind of had a fork in the road where they could either double down on it and, you know, even give a slot in the phone to keep the S Pen and hopefully that would be the thing that people loved about it or they could see that people really weren't using the future very much and so they took away the digitizer and made that part of the screen, the UTG actually a little thicker and and just done away with it. I think that's gonna anger some people on YouTube because we're the ones that like that feature, but in general, most people didn't use it, so it's gone. But then the second, the medium deal is the price went up by 100 bucks for the base price. So, it was $1899, now it's 1999 base. It was already expensive. Now, it's even more expensive. The ultra cameras and the thinner design and everything this year, 2,000 bucks to get a foldable. Now, it's not a downgrade. It's actually the same exact size as last year. It's a 4,400 millah battery. And again, for those of you just in Samsung world, that feels about right. Like, it can't possibly have the same size battery as the flagship since it has to split it in half and put a hinge in the middle. So, okay, 4,400 feels about right. But with a $2,000 phone, I just feel the need to at least point out that silicon carbon batteries do exist, and Samsung has been notoriously safe over the past few years about improving their batteries. So, it feels like they're leaving something on the table here by not doing silicon carbon. Just for some context, just so you know, this is the Honor Magic V5. It's coming out not even in the US. This is a phone you might not have heard of if you're not in this world, but this phone is even thinner than Samsung's. It's about the same weight and it has a 5,820 mAh battery thanks to it being silicon carbon and fast charging and everything. It's a big difference versus 4,400. So, if you are the type to use a phone, like a power user, which if you're spending this much money on a phone, let's face it, you probably are. Or if you use the phone a lot open with this big 8 in display, you're probably thinking a lot about battery life. So, it is kind of a bummer to see Samsung still playing it so safe in that department. Maybe they'll get on the train soon. Who knows? Now, the Z Flip 7 also did make some interesting changes. Potentially two steps forward, one step back. Depends on how this goes. So, this is a smaller, cheaper hamburger style flipping phone. It is the same 1099 starting price as last year. But you'll notice everything is bigger, which at first was a little concerning because the ZFlip is like one of the last small phones, but I think you open it and it's a big phone, so maybe it doesn't matter. But I'll start on the inside because it's pretty simple. It's gone from 6.7 to 6.9 in diagonally. So now it feels like a proper large flagship slab phone when you're using it unfolded. Obviously, everything benefits from it being bigger, watching videos, taking pictures, and of course, they fit a bigger battery in there, too. Up to 4,300 from 4,000. No surprise here. But then they also took advantage of the larger frame to make the cover display closed way more usable as well. And this has been a trend with the past few years with this flip. But this year, they finally did the thing. They just went full corner to corner just like the Razer. So those camera rings are just cutouts through the screen now. Now, it's a 4.1 inch edgetoedge cover display, and it's even brighter and 120 hertz now, too. So, this phone is more usable than ever while it's closed. Maybe you want to triage those notifications or flip through some widgets or even take selfies with the main camera, as many people do. It's all better than ever before. Once again, a pretty impressive hardware win-win. It's better closed and better open with the same update, and it doesn't feel too big or unwieldly. But then the slightly possibly concerning update is they've gone back from a Snapdragon chip to an Exynos chip in this phone. So last Flip was a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. This one is the Exynos 2500 in the Flip 7. Now I don't think it's a bad chip. I just don't think that it's as good as the Snapdragon 8 Elite is right now with the combination of peak performance and power efficiency. But apparently this is something to keep an eye on because this could be a preview of the S26. Allegedly Samsung may be looking to switch fully back to Exynos for everything across the board. That's a rumor that's been floating that it may be a 2nm processor and possibly leveling up performance for that. But we'll see. But as of right now, that's the story for the Fold 7 and Flip 7. Now I'm publishing this the day of Samsung's Unpacked. So their event is going to have some other stuff announced as well. The Watch 8 is one of them. And I'm loving the circular design, but it also actually has a new feature to measure toxins in your body through your skin in the form of an antioxidant index. So, you actually have to take the watch off and measure it through your thumb and then it can tell you if you've been drinking enough or if your diet has been trash, I guess. There's also a Flip 7 FE fan edition, which is essentially a Flip 6 with an XNOS 2400 for $8.99. But let me know if you want anything else from that event covered. I'll be watching it just the same as you guys. And also shout out to Ridge partner and channel sponsor who is running a huge summer sale right now. So if you flip over to ridge.com/mkbhd or even on Amazon actually, you'll see a bunch of stuff, various rings and luggage and wallets on sale up to 49% off until this Friday. So, just a little call out for you guys to get a great deal at prices you probably won't see again for gear that you'll actually use. Sneaky good deal. The matte black everything wallet. This is one of the first things I helped to design once I joined as a chief creative partner. All matte black, but then oil filled lettering engravings at the bottom. Pretty fire. $69. Nice. And Ridge does, whether there's a sale or not, they do a 99-day risk-free trial period. That's a pretty big deal. Basically, for 99 days, you use this and if at any point you realize you don't like it, you can send it back and get your money back. That's hard for companies like Ridge to offer, but they do anyway cuz they stand by the quality of this stuff. And then the same durability and lifetime warranty that you already trust. It's all good stuff over there. So, head over there quick, get something that you like before it's over this Friday. It's one of the best sales I've seen them run. Okay. Thanks to Ridge for sponsoring this portion of the video. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. [Music]","Tick. Tock.

2025-07-08,Nothing Phone 3 Review: They Lied!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KbrxIpQgkM,"(funky upbeat music) - This is the Nothing Phone 3 and yeah, it's ugly. (funky music) You know, people say beauty is in the eye of the beholder and stuff like that. I get it. You can find
beauty in anything, for sure. But also, you know,
there's a nice alignment to things that feels good. And you know, when things are, when things are where
you expect them to be, doesn't that feel better? Okay. All right, carcinisation. I learned about this recently. This is a strange and
odd but funny phenomenon and evolutionary biology where a bunch of undersea crustaceans have
all slowly evolved towards the same, flat, robust, crab-like shape because it seems to be
the ideal form factor for surviving in the ocean. Oversimplified, it feels
like everything down there is evolving towards a crab. And look at all these crabs, lots of smartphones today
basically look the same. So when something that comes
along looks a little different, well it's gonna feel weird, isn't it? But hey, maybe someone's
into the layered glass look with the text in various places. Maybe you're into the
red dot turning into a functional record light. Maybe you're into a bit of a lobster. Real talk though, it feels
like every few months Nothing comes out with a new
product that looks crazy and people hate on all the pictures on the internet 'cause they look weird. And then two months later
we're all used to it and we forget about the looks and we can focus on the product itself. So let's just skip all that
and focus on the product. This is what Nothing is calling
their first true flagship, which is what you would
say if you're Nothing and you're charging $799 for a
phone for the first time ever after rolling around in the budget and mid-range space for a few years. But I've been using this
phone for the better part of the last week and I'm gonna disagree with the whole premise here actually. This is no more of a
flagship phone than any of Nothing's previous phones. Now are they lying to us? Eh, not exactly but kind of. Hear me out. 799 is the same price
as a Samsung Galaxy S25 or the Pixel 9, or right
underneath the iPhone 16. Like they're competing against
bonafide flagships from mega companies with basically unlimited money. And part of what we've come
to expect from phones in this class is basically giving
us the best available stuff. Like it's kind of this unspoken rule, but if you're spending
this much, you deserve to just get the best parts, right? That's why it's been so easy for me to rag on like the Pixel in the past for not having the best performance or the iPhone for not having
a high refresh rate display. So this Nothing Phone 3, it's certainly dressed up like a flagship and it is the most flagship
yet of any Nothing phone. It is huge. It's got this super bright,
high refresh rate, OLED display. It has a massive new
silicon carbon battery, new triple 50 megapixel
cameras, IP 68 certification, up to 16 gigs of RAM. Like it's got all the makings
of what could be a flagship. But when you peel back the
mask, just a little bit, like right under the surface,
it's the same exact strategy that Nothing has been running on all their previous phones in the past. The playbook is to just cut back just a little
bit from the highest end stuff in ways that hopefully
you, the buyer, don't notice. And it still feels like a flagship, but that allows 'em to cut costs and undercut the competition a little bit. So it works. It's not a bad strategy. It's allowed 'em to make
great phones in the past, but it's just harder to sell
that strategy at this price. So for starters, the chip inside, right? It's not the expensive,
proven, powerful flagship Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. This is running the
Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead. It's one of the first phones
we've seen using this chip. And to be fair, it is much
better than anything we've seen in any previous Nothing phone. It's a four nanometer chip, it's something like 40% better CPU and like 90% better GPU than
the chip in the two year-old Nothing Phone 2. The phone is zippy and smooth as hell, basically all the time. And I'll get to the software
experience in a second. But is it the best available?
Well, technically no. The Snapdragon 8 Elite still smokes this. You can see benchmark
scores, it's pretty clear that's still the flagship chip. Now you as the user
might never notice that. In fact you probably wouldn't
if you just used the phone side by side in a lot of
random, normal activities. But if you happen to get into
graphically intensive gaming or the most intense tasks,
that's what separates a flagship from an upper mid-range chip. So for some context, some
other phones using this chip, the Poco F7 and the Iqoo Neo 10, both of these are sub $500 phones. I also think they were
very clever pairing it up with 12 gigs of RAM and
256 gigs of storage base. It's fast Ram, it's UFS 4.0 and then the upgraded
version for 899 is 16 gigs of RAM and half a terabyte. Awesome to see that. But
there is no 8 128 version. And I think if they did make one, that would probably be
like 699, but they didn't. Now when we get to the outside
of this phone, there is this, again, huge new AMOLED display. Surely it's a flagship display, right? It's gigantic. It's 6.67 inches corner to corner with perfectly even
bezels all the way around, that takes extra work. It's a gorgeous AMOLED,
nice color reproduction and it's also, it's a
good amount over 1080P. It's nice and sharp, smooth with that dynamic refresh
rate up to 120 hertz and it gets crazy bright,
1600 nits outdoors, 4,500 nits peak brightness with HDR. So the numbers on paper go crazy and it's just, it's such
a nice screen to look at. I've loved using it. So
what's the catch, Marques? Well one, you would
literally never know this unless you check the spec sheet, but the glass protecting
the front of this display, it's Gorilla Glass 7i, and that is a mid-range
glass in their lineup where you might see flagships
using the more durable Gorilla Glass Victus or Victus 2. And normally I wouldn't even bring that up but that's definitely something
to consider on a phone that is meant to spend a
lot of its time face down. And then another thing, there are a lot of like really nice, subtle
things that go into this screen. Like it has a 1,000
hertz touch sample rate, so it's even more responsive
than the phone too. It also has 2160 hertz PWM dimming and it also has a very acceptable
optical fingerprint reader down near the bottom. But it's also an LTPS display, instead of the most premium LTPO. And all that really means
in practice is instead of varying a refresh rate
from one to 120 hertz, it can go from 30 to 120 hertz. You would never notice, but
it does mean a little bit worse power efficiency. I'll tell you what though, it
can actually absolutely handle the slightly worse power efficiency because the battery in
this phone is elite. It's marketed as a 5100
50 milliamp power battery, but according to Nothing
and it gets complicated but it's actually rated at a
5,500 milliamp power battery. It's silicon carbon, it
charges extra fast at 65 watts. It supports wireless charging,
reverse wireless charging, reverse wired charging. It's great. It sips power in standby and it's genuinely a two day
phone if you want it to be, even without the more
efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite. So honestly flagship battery for sure. So then, okay, what about the cameras? Triple 50 megapixel cameras
feels pretty flagship. And you know what, again, it is closer to a flagship than any previous Nothing phone has ever been, but I've used this now for a little bit. It's still a notch behind
the S25's and Pixel 9's and iPhone 16's of the world. The mainstream flagships
that I'm comparing this to. This main sensor is the
biggest they've ever used, one over 1.3 inches. It lets a ton more light in
and I'm shooting with this and I realize as I'm looking through all the pictures I've taken, for some reason it's frequently soft. Like even on a perfectly normal shot, the colors will be fine,
the exposure will be fine, but the subject of the
photo when I zoom in, it should be in sharp focus
but it's just a little bit off. I think you can blame this
a little bit on auto focus, maybe a little bit on
tuning for a larger sensor with shallower depth of field. It's definitely capable of good pictures and it's a little bit wider
than you might expect, but yeah, that's a little bit odd. Then the telephoto is 3x, also
a tiny bit soft sometimes, but also very useful. It's where your macro shots come from and you can get some really
sick, impressive closeups and the ultra wide and the selfie cameras, they are the most consistent
and most flagship of them all. But yeah, like I said, the whole camera setup is just one notch behind those things. And you may only notice
if you're zooming in and pixel peeping. But again, that's the point. Mostly good enough for most
people, most of the time. I think with a little tuning,
this can be an A minus camera. I think a perfect
encapsulation of the priorities of this phone are, I mean
look at, look at this design. It's an insane design but
technically no camera bump. I mean the rings obviously
protrude a little bit, but most flagship phones at
this point also have some sort of big camera bump that they all sit on. It turns out to get this
whole big telephoto camera to not have a bump that actually
engineered part of the PCV or the board inside to have a hole in it. So the optics could
actually split like punch through the PCB instead of being stacked totally on top of it. I'm sure we'll see this in
like a JerryRigEverything tear down video at some point. But yeah, basically mission
accomplished, no camera bump, but that also meant they had to use some smaller parts to make it work. And this is actually a
physically smaller telephoto than the cheaper Nothing Phone 3a Pro. So spoiler, the design
is still the priority of this phone, always has been. But let's talk about the
most controversial bit of this design, which is the glyphs, which made Nothing Phones famous for a couple years. This year, the glyph lights are gone and replacing them is this
small display on the back upper corner of the phone. It's 489 LED pixels. They're calling it Glyph Matrix. On its face, this has
some usefulness about it, but then it's also surrounded by gimmicks. Okay, so the basic idea is
like your phone is face down and then the lights on
the back would light up and you could tell something
about what that notification is to decide if you wanna actually
pick it up and check or not. So if that is all you're after, then okay, success, you know, more
pixels means more information. The new essential
notifications builder is super powerful and informative. It's better than ever before. I can set up a certain
icon to come up in the dots whenever I get a certain
type of notification or anything from a certain person or from a certain app. Let's say I wanna be able
to leave my phone face down, but I never wanna miss any
notifications from Mom, ever. Okay, set that up. No matter what she sends,
no matter how she sends it, I will get an icon or a
picture from my gallery or something that it can
turn into dots and done. Anytime mom calls or texts or whatever, I can't see what they said, but I can see that she sent me something. So that's convenient, that's functional. Outside of that, it immediately starts feeling
way more gimmicky, like, okay, take another look at the back
of this phone, you see a, you see this little dot
here hidden in this design? This little circle is actually
a pressure sensitive area. And when you press that,
the back display lights up and then you can use a
single press to cycle through these glyph toys and then a long press to
actually engage with them. So you can cycle to a timer and then start a timer on
the back of your phone, which doesn't sync up
with the actual clock app. So if you turn your phone
screen on the timer disappears. So be careful. You can also use the back display as a viewfinder for your
main camera kind of, or you can play spin the bottle. Maybe you're into that. Maybe you and your friends
don't have a bottle handy, but you have your Nothing phone. Or you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against your own phone. I think you get the idea. They're fun tech demos, but the
utility runs out real quick. Now they have opened up the API. So developers, if they want to, can make more stuff for the back screen. I, you know, with this
phone, I don't really know how many actually will, like, is Spotify gonna make like album art, cover art on the back of the phone here? I don't know. But the Nothing community has
already started developing some stuff and messing with it. They've made this one.
This is a magic eight ball. So instead of turning your phone over and asking Google for a magic eight ball, you can ask the back of your phone and it'll give you a little message. Cool. Look, the real best part of a Nothing phone is still
the software on the front of the phone because Nothing OS 3.5, soon to be updated to
4.0, it's just great. Like they have this tastefully modified version of Android with
this nice aesthetic, finely-tuned, smooth performance and a handful of useful features that they just sort of sprinkle in there. So you can sort of choose
which ones you want to use or easily ignore. The AI-powered essential
space continues to evolve and get more features, though it doesn't sync with anything externally. So I don't use it. And yes, there's still a custom button for it on the side of the phone, but it's not too in-your-face. You can ignore it if
you don't wanna use it. And the little things like being able to resize the quick settings toggles or the way you can swipe up
on the camera app to flip through presets, which is so clean. Everything is, it's clean,
it's smoothly animated and the whole OS is responsive in ways that feel higher end than
the specs would ever suggest. I think the best new
feature on this phone is the universal search box. So you might actually
kind of get it confused 'cause there's a permanent
Google search box on the bottom of the home screen at all times. Not that search box, but when you pull up the
app drawer, that search box. Now, that one searches through
your stuff on your phone, like usual, or you can ask it a question and hit that AI button and it'll use a modified
version of Gemini to go online and pull up a short and
sweet answer for you. It's tuned to kind of just be brief and give you answers to stuff. It's nice. And again, you can choose to use it or just never even try. You can just leave it tucked away and it's just, you can use
it the way you normally do and just search for
your apps on your phone. And this is also gonna get updates. They are gonna do, they're
promising five years of major software updates. I could do the nitpicky thing and be like, oh, Samsung's
doing seven years and Apple does even more. So it's not quite a flagship, but you've seen how flagships kind of vary all over the board. So I'm giving them flagship
credit for the software. So at the end of the day, is the title of this review a little dramatic maybe? Sure. But flagship, the word flagship
is being used here heavily as a marketing term. And so maybe the review title should just been Nothing Phone 3, They Did Marketing, whatever. But the point is, it still stands. They're charging 799 for this phone and there are other really good phones that you can get for that much money. So this phone, just like previous
Nothing Phones is the one that you would get if you really care, not so much about raw specs,
but about good software and a unique design. You don't want another
crab, you want lobster. Thanks for watching. Catch
you guys the next one. Peace. (funky upbeat music)","So you want to be a flagship?
